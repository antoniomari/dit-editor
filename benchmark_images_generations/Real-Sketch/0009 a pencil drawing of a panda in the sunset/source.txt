Generate a grayscale image in a realistic pencil sketch style.  The scene depicts a tranquil, serene lakeside sunset.

**Foreground:** The immediate foreground is dominated by a wooden dock or boardwalk. Render the wood planks with highly detailed, parallel lines suggesting the texture of the wood grain.  The planks should run horizontally across the entire width of the image, receding into the middle distance.

**Midground:** Beyond the dock, tall grasses or reeds line the edge of a calm lake or river.  The reeds should be meticulously rendered with varying shades of gray to create depth and texture.  The reeds should appear slightly reflective in the still water. The water itself should be relatively smooth with subtle ripples or reflections of the setting sun.

**Background:** A large, low-hanging sun is partially obscured by a hazy or cloudy sky. The sun should be rendered with a soft, slightly diffused light, implying a late afternoon or early evening setting. A few small birds are silhouetted against the setting sun and sky. The sky should be rendered with subtle shading using many short, horizontal lines to indicate the clouds and atmospheric perspective.


**Lighting:** The lighting is soft and diffused, typical of a sunset. The light source is the setting sun, casting a warm glow on the scene, even though the image is in grayscale.  The shadows are soft and not harshly defined.  Pay attention to the reflection of the sun on the water.

**Style:** The overall style is highly realistic, mimicking a detailed pencil sketch. Use a range of values from light gray to very dark gray to create depth and dimension.  The lines should be consistently rendered, showing careful attention to detail and texture.


**Composition:** The composition should be balanced. Use the rule of thirds to place the horizon line and sun. The dock acts as a strong leading line, guiding the viewer's eye into the scene. The reeds frame the scene, creating a natural border.  The overall atmosphere should convey peace and tranquility.

Add a small, subtle signature "毛杯" (Mào Bēi) in the bottom right corner.
