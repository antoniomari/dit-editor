Generate a grayscale image depicting a serene lakeside scene at sunset.  The background is a pencil sketch style rendering of tall grasses bordering a calm body of water. The water reflects a large, partially obscured sun setting on the horizon.  Several small birds are subtly depicted flying in the sky above the grasses. The sky itself is rendered with varying shades of gray to suggest a twilight atmosphere. The grasses are detailed with individual strokes to show texture, and the water is smoothly shaded to imply stillness.  A simple, horizontally-oriented wooden dock or boardwalk extends from the bottom center across the foreground of the sketch.

In the foreground, centrally positioned on the boardwalk, is a realistically rendered sheep. The sheep is predominantly light gray/off-white with some subtle darker gray shading around its flanks to suggest depth and texture of its wool.  There is a hint of a pinkish hue visible in parts of its wool, possibly indicating a slight discoloration or shadow effect. The sheep stands calmly, facing slightly towards the viewer, and appears to be looking slightly to its left. The texture of the wool should be visible, with individual strands suggested, and the sheep's face and legs should be relatively detailed compared to the overall sketch-like style of the background.

The sheep should be superimposed onto the background, appearing as though it has been seamlessly added to the scene.  The style of the sheep is significantly more realistic than the sketched background, creating a contrast between the two styles. The lighting on the sheep should be consistent with the overall sunset lighting of the scene, with subtle shadows indicating the direction of the setting sun.  The overall effect should be a slightly surreal juxtaposition of a photorealistic animal placed within a pencil sketch landscape, creating a visually interesting contrast and a calming, slightly whimsical atmosphere. The artistâ€™s signature, appearing as a small set of characters in a minimalist style, is placed near the bottom right corner.
