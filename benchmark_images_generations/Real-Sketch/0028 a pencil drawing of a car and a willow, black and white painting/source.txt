Generate a grayscale image in a sketchy, impressionistic style reminiscent of pencil or charcoal drawings.  The overall composition should feel peaceful and somewhat melancholic.

The focal point is a leafless, gnarled tree situated slightly off-center to the left. The tree is rendered with many fine, expressive lines suggesting its branches' intricate structure. The branches are somewhat irregular and windswept in appearance, creating a sense of age and resilience. Its crown is rounded and full, but the individual branches are clearly defined.  The texture of the tree should suggest a slightly rough bark.

The tree sits on a gently sloping hill rendered with short, parallel lines suggesting grass and plowed earth.  This hill leads down to a calm body of water, depicted with softly curving, horizontal lines that suggest gentle ripples or a still surface.  Beyond the water, rolling hills rise in the background. These hills are represented with longer, more dynamic lines showing their contours and suggesting a sense of depth and distance. The lines used for the hills create a sense of texture, with some areas denser than others suggesting shading and form.

The lighting in the scene is soft and diffused, suggesting an overcast day or soft, even light. There are no harsh shadows.  The overall tonal range should be subtle, with mostly mid-tones and a slight contrast between the darker tree and the lighter background. The style should evoke a sense of minimalism and natural beauty, avoiding excessive detail.  The lines should feel organic and hand-drawn rather than precisely geometric. The overall mood should be contemplative and serene.
