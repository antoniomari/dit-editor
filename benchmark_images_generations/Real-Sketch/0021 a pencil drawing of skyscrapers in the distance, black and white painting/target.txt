Generate an image depicting a serene, pencil-sketch style landscape. The background should resemble a tranquil river scene drawn in grayscale, featuring a gently curving river, sparse vegetation including palm trees and small shrubs, and a small hut visible near the water's edge.  The style should mimic traditional pencil sketching with varying shades of gray to create depth and texture. A small, stylized figure in a boat is seen on the river, and another figure is seated under a tree, playing a flute. The tree is large and full, its leaves rendered in varying shades of gray to suggest volume.  

The foreground element is a cluster of modern, glass-fronted skyscrapers. This cluster is positioned in the mid-ground, slightly overlapping the river and partially obscuring the hut. The skyscrapers should appear realistically rendered, with a sharp contrast to the sketchy style of the rest of the scene. They should be depicted with highly detailed reflections and sharp lines, as if they were a photograph pasted onto the sketch. The overall effect should be jarring, suggesting a juxtaposition of the old and new worlds.  The skyscrapers should be positioned so that they appear to have been inserted into the sketch, perhaps even slightly "floating" above the river, to emphasize the unnatural placement within the otherwise peaceful scene.  The lighting should be consistent; the skyscrapers should be illuminated as if it's daylight, but the pencil sketch should remain in consistent grayscale.
