Generate a grayscale image of a serene landscape featuring a large, setting sun partially obscured by tall grasses reflected in calm water.  The sky is a graduated grayscale, darkening towards the horizon. Several small birds are depicted in flight across the upper portion of the image. The overall style should mimic a pencil sketch with varying shading to suggest depth and texture.  The grasses in the foreground are detailed with individual strands, while the water is smooth with subtle shading to reflect the light. A wooden boardwalk or deck is visible at the bottom, stretching across the image from edge to edge, directly in front of the water's edge.  The lines of the wood should be clearly visible.

In the foreground, slightly overlapping the bottom edge of the boardwalk, place a realistic rendering of a baby elephant. The elephant should be facing the viewer, slightly angled to the left. It should appear as a high-resolution photograph digitally integrated into the drawing.  The baby elephant should be dark gray/blueish-gray in color, with visible wrinkles and texture in its skin.  It is walking, with its legs slightly apart.  The elephant's size is small relative to the landscape, but large enough to be the clear focal point besides the sunset. The lighting on the elephant should be consistent with the overall grayscale palette of the scene; making sure the elephant's shading complements the existing drawingâ€™s style.  A small artist's signature in a simple script font should be in the bottom right corner.
