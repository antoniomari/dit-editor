Generate a grayscale image depicting a serene lakeside sunset scene.  The background should be a pencil sketch style rendering with a focus on realism within the constraints of the medium.  The sky should be a graduated tone from lighter at the horizon to darker near the top, suggesting twilight.  A large, realistic sun should be partially obscured by the horizon, reflecting softly on the calm water. Tall grasses and reeds should line the water's edge, rendered with varied line weights and shading to suggest depth and texture.  A simple wooden boardwalk should extend across the bottom of the image, also rendered in pencil sketch style with visible wood grain and linear perspective.  A few small birds should be depicted in flight across the sky.

In the foreground, add a high-resolution photograph of a gray squirrel, positioned centrally, sitting on the boardwalk.  The squirrel should appear to be nestled within the scene, interacting naturally with its environment, as if it is observing the sunset. The lighting on the squirrel should be consistent with the ambient light of the sunset scene.  The squirrel should be slightly out of focus compared to the crispness of the background sketch to subtly emphasize the contrast between the photo and the drawing.  The overall effect should be a harmonious blend of photographic realism and pencil sketch artistry. The style should be similar to a drawing found in a nature journal or wildlife sketchbook.  Include a small, stylized Japanese kanji character (毛球 - literally meaning "hairy ball", figuratively "squirrel") in the lower right corner of the image, rendered in a light gray tone to complement the overall grayscale palette.
