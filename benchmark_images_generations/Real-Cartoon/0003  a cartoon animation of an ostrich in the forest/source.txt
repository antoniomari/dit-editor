Generate a cartoon-style image of a forest clearing.  The style should be reminiscent of children's book illustrations, with smooth lines and slightly muted, yet vibrant colors.

The scene depicts a sandy, pale-yellow clearing in the center of the frame, taking up roughly the lower half.  This clearing is uneven, with subtle undulations in the sand, and a few small tufts of bright green grass sparsely scattered across it.

The upper half of the frame is filled with a dense forest. The trees are primarily large, thick-trunked, and have dark brown bark.  Their leaves are a lush, medium green, slightly darker in the shadowed areas under the canopy.  The trees vary slightly in height and shape, creating a sense of natural depth, but they are generally consistent in color and style.  Between the trees, there's undergrowth of smaller, brighter green bushes and shrubs.  Some hints of reddish-brown foliage can be seen near the base of the trees, providing subtle color variation.

The lighting is soft and diffused, suggesting an overcast day or dappled sunlight filtering through the leaves.  There are no harsh shadows; the overall illumination is even and gentle, contributing to the peaceful, storybook atmosphere.

The composition should be balanced, with the clearing acting as a visual focal point, drawing the eye toward the center of the image. The trees should frame the clearing, creating a sense of enclosure and tranquility. The overall mood should be calm, inviting, and whimsical.
