Generate a vibrant, cartoon-style image of a park scene nestled beside a cityscape.

**Scene:** The focal point is a park path winding gently through a lush, green landscape.  A simple wooden bench sits in the foreground, near a small, calm river or stream.  The path leads towards a backdrop of modern, stylized skyscrapers.  Autumnal trees with bright yellow, orange, and red leaves frame the scene, providing a contrast of colors.  Several bushes and plants with varying autumnal foliage are scattered throughout the park area, especially prominently in the bottom right corner.

**Lighting:** The scene is brightly lit, suggesting a sunny day. The light is even and soft, with no harsh shadows, giving a cheerful and inviting atmosphere.  The sky is a clear, vivid blue.  Clouds are present but fluffy and white, not dark or stormy.

**Style:** The style should be distinctly cartoonish. Lines should be clean and bold, with slightly exaggerated shapes and proportions. The color palette is bright and saturated, emphasizing autumnal tones with greens, yellows, oranges and reds.   The overall feel should be reminiscent of children's book illustrations or a cheerful video game background.

**Composition:** The composition utilizes a perspective that leads the viewer's eye from the foreground bench towards the cityscape in the background. The path acts as a natural guide for the gaze.  The placement of the trees and buildings is balanced, creating a pleasant visual harmony without being perfectly symmetrical. The slightly curved river adds dynamism to the scene. Two lampposts are situated along the path, adding detail and contributing to the park-like atmosphere.
