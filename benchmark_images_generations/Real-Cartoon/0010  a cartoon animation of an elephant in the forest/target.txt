Generate an image of a stylized cartoon forest scene.  The background should depict a clearing in a lush green forest.  The trees are thick-trunked, with large, rounded green canopies. The ground is a light sandy-tan color, with patches of green grass and small bushes. The overall style should be reminiscent of children's book illustrations, with slightly exaggerated features and vibrant, saturated colors.

In the foreground, add a single Asian elephant. The elephant should be positioned centrally in the clearing, slightly off-center toward the lower portion of the image. It should be rendered realistically compared to the cartoonish background, exhibiting a dark grey/brown skin tone, and be detailed enough to show individual wrinkles in its skin. Its trunk should be slightly lowered, as if itâ€™s grazing or exploring the ground.  The elephant should be roughly the same scale as the trees in terms of perceived size, making it appear a significant presence in the clearing. The presence of the elephant should not change the composition of the background in any way; it is simply added to the existing scene, not integrated or interacting with the background elements besides standing on the ground.  The lighting should be consistent throughout, indicating a bright, sunny day.  Ensure there is no visible shadow from the elephant on the ground. The overall effect should be a whimsical juxtaposition of realistic and cartoonish styles.
