Generate an image of a breakfast scene on a red and white checkered tablecloth.  The style should be cartoonish and vibrant, similar to a children's book illustration.


The scene includes:

* **A white plate:** Centered, holding two sunny-side-up eggs with bright yellow yolks and slightly crispy whites.  A small garnish of two halved cherry tomatoes and some parsley sprigs sits beside the eggs.

* **A croissant:** A golden-brown croissant, slightly buttery-looking, positioned diagonally below and to the right of the plate. It should look freshly baked and slightly flaky.

* **A wedge of cheese:** A large, bright yellow wedge of cheese, with visible texture and small holes suggesting Swiss cheese, sits to the upper right of the plate.  It should appear slightly glossy.

* **A mug of coffee:** A white mug filled with dark brown coffee, steaming gently, placed to the lower right of the cheese. The steam should be stylized and not overly realistic.

* **A saucer:**  A white saucer under the coffee mug.

* **Tablecloth:**  A red and white checkered tablecloth provides a lively background.

**Lighting:** The scene should be brightly lit, with soft, diffused light to avoid harsh shadows.  The colors should be saturated and cheerful.

**Composition:** The items are arranged asymmetrically but naturally, creating a visually appealing composition without being overly structured. The eye should naturally move around the various food items.

The overall feel should be inviting and appetizing, suggesting a delicious and wholesome breakfast. The level of detail should be moderate â€“ sufficient to be clearly identifiable but not hyperrealistic. The image should maintain a clean, crisp look, suitable for use in a children's book or a website targeting families.
