Generate an image of a cartoon forest clearing with a realistic red fox sitting in the center.

**Background:** The background should be a stylized cartoon illustration of a forest clearing.  The clearing is primarily a light sandy/tan color with slightly irregular edges.  The surrounding forest consists of several large, dark brown trees with relatively simple, rounded green crowns. The undergrowth is depicted with stylized clumps of green and reddish-brown bushes.  The style should be reminiscent of children's book illustrations, with smooth lines and slightly saturated colors. The lighting is even and soft, suggestive of a daytime scene.

**Foreground:**  The foreground element is a photorealistic red fox. The fox should be sitting upright, facing the viewer, its body mostly in profile but with its head slightly turned towards the camera. Its fur should be richly colored and detailed, showing individual strands of fur and a realistic texture. It should appear to be sitting on the sandy ground of the clearing. The fox's size should be appropriate to the scale of the background, neither too large nor too small to appear out of place.  Make sure that there is a slight shadow under the fox to ground it to the scene.


**Interaction:** The fox should be seamlessly integrated into the cartoon background. It shouldn't appear to be pasted on; the lighting and shadows should be consistent between the fox and the background, although the fox should have a more realistic shading style than the background.


**Overall scene:** The final image should have a charming and slightly surreal quality, due to the juxtaposition of a photorealistic fox within a cartoon setting.  The overall feeling should be whimsical, yet slightly intriguing.  The fox should be the clear focal point of the image.
