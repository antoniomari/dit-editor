Generate an image of a beach scene at sunset.  The background should depict a calm body of water, with a large multi-span bridge stretching across the far side. Beyond the bridge, a cityscape is visible, featuring a mix of modern and older buildings, including a prominent, tall, rectangular building that appears to be a hotel or office tower. The sky should be a dramatic mix of sunset colors â€“ oranges, pinks, and purples, blending into cooler blues and grays higher up, with a substantial cloud cover. The overall light should suggest the time just after sunset.

In the foreground, a single Emperor penguin is positioned on a dark-grey sandy beach. The penguin is facing away from the camera, slightly angled to its left. It should be sharply in focus and realistically rendered. Its plumage should be highly detailed, showing the white belly, black back and characteristic yellow patches on its chest.  The penguin appears somewhat out of place, creating a surreal juxtaposition against the urban and coastal setting.  The beach extends from the bottom edge to the calm water's edge, forming a strip of land separating the penguin from the water and the cityscape beyond. The sand should appear somewhat coarse and textured.  The water should reflect the colors of the sky and the city lights faintly.

The penguin's size should be appropriately scaled to suggest it's a full-grown adult bird, and its pose should be natural and somewhat inquisitive, as though observing the scene before it. There should be no other animals or people present. The overall mood should be slightly whimsical yet tranquil, highlighting the unexpected placement of the penguin in this unusual setting.
