Generate a photorealistic image of a young man sitting on a tree stump in a park, facing away from the camera.  The man is of Middle Eastern descent, with dark hair and wearing a maroon t-shirt. He is sitting cross-legged, his posture relaxed and contemplative.


The park is characterized by a vibrant green, well-maintained lawn that stretches from the foreground towards a line of mature trees.  These trees are varied, a mix of tall, slender pines with dark green needles, broader-leafed deciduous trees, and some cypress-like trees. The trees form a dense, lush backdrop, creating a sense of depth and tranquility.  A paved path runs parallel to the tree line, almost hidden under the trees.


The lighting is soft and diffused, suggestive of either early morning or late afternoon sunlight. The sky is a pale, clear blue with only a few wispy clouds, indicating a calm and peaceful atmosphere. The overall lighting should be natural and even, avoiding harsh shadows.


The style should be photorealistic, capturing the fine details of the grass blades, tree textures, and the man's clothing. The overall composition should be balanced, with the man as the focal point, but allowing the viewer's eye to wander across the expanse of the lawn and into the background of trees. The perspective should be slightly elevated, giving a view of the scene from a gentle angle.  The image should have a serene and slightly melancholic mood.  The colors should be natural and muted, with the greens of the grass and trees being the dominant hues.
