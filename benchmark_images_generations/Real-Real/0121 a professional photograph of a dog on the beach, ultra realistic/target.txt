Generate an image of a tranquil waterfront scene at sunset.  The background should feature a long, multi-span bridge stretching across a calm body of water.  The bridge should be a dark gray or steel color. Beyond the bridge, a cityscape is visible, featuring at least one tall, rectangular building in a dark gray or dark brown color, possibly a hotel or office building. The sky should be a beautiful sunset palette, with a mix of pink, orange, and purple hues, with fluffy clouds. The water should be relatively still, reflecting the colors of the sky and the cityscape.

In the foreground, place a small, fluffy dog, appearing to be a long-haired Yorkshire Terrier or similar breed. The dog should be light tan and white in color and lying down on a dark brown, sandy beach. The dog should be positioned slightly off-center, looking somewhat towards the camera.  The dog should be slightly partially buried in the sand, as if it's resting comfortably.  The overall lighting should be soft and warm, consistent with the sunset. The dog should be in sharp focus, while the background elements retain some detail but are slightly softer in focus, creating a shallow depth of field effect. The overall mood should be peaceful and serene.  The sand in the foreground should be textured and detailed, showing small pebbles and grains of sand.
