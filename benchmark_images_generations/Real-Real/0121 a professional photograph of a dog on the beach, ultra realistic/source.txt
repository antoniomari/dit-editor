Generate an image depicting a serene waterfront scene at sunset or sunrise.

**Scene:** The central focus is a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water.  The bridge is a muted grey, with subtle variations in tone to suggest concrete texture. The water beneath appears relatively still, with a gentle, barely perceptible motion suggested by subtle reflections and a slight blurring effect.  Beyond the bridge, a cityscape is visible, featuring a prominent, dark-colored high-rise building to the right.  Other buildings are also present, but less distinct.  The foreground is a sandy beach, coarse and textured, extending from the bottom edge, drawing the viewer’s eye towards the bridge and cityscape.

**Lighting:** The lighting is that of the "golden hour," either just after sunrise or just before sunset. The sky is a blend of soft pastel colours, with muted pinks, oranges, and yellows near the horizon, gradually transitioning into cool blues and greys higher up. Clouds are present, somewhat diffused and not overly dramatic, adding depth to the sky. The overall lighting should be soft and diffused, avoiding harsh shadows. The bridge is slightly silhouetted against the brighter sky.

**Style:** The image should have a slightly photorealistic style, with a touch of artistic license in the colour grading and smoothing of the water’s surface. The overall mood is calm, peaceful, and contemplative.  The focus should be sharp on the bridge and the closest part of the beach, with a gradual softening in focus towards the background cityscape.

**Composition:**  Use a low-angle perspective from the beach, looking towards the bridge and the cityscape. The bridge should occupy a significant portion of the middle ground, with the cityscape in the distant background. The sandy beach should be prominent in the foreground, taking up approximately a third of the frame, creating depth of field. The rule of thirds composition guideline could be beneficial here. The sky should occupy a significant portion of the upper part of the frame.


Overall, the image should evoke a sense of tranquility and showcase the beauty of the bridge and cityscape silhouetted against a stunning sunset/sunrise sky.
