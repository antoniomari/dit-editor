Generate an image of a delicious-looking tiramisu cake slice on a white plate, surrounded by fresh strawberries.


**Scene:** A close-up shot of a single slice of tiramisu cake, prominently featured in the center of a white, rectangular plate. The cake is angled slightly to reveal its layered structure.  Around the cake are several ripe, red strawberries, arranged casually but attractively.  A subtle background suggests a softly lit, indoor setting, possibly a kitchen or dining area.  A hint of a blurred background element, possibly a light-colored wall or ceramic item, is permissible but should not distract from the cake and strawberries.


**Lighting:** The lighting should be soft and diffused, avoiding harsh shadows. The cake should be well-lit to showcase its creamy texture and layers, with a gentle highlight on the glossy top.  The strawberries should also be brightly lit, highlighting their glossy surfaces and the details of their texture. The overall lighting should create a warm, inviting ambiance.


**Style:** The style should be photorealistic, with a focus on accurate representation of textures and colors. The image should have a clean, professional look, similar to high-quality food photography. The overall feel should be appetizing and inviting, suggestive of a dessert that is both elegant and delicious.


**Composition:** The cake should be the central focus of the image, with the strawberries arranged in a visually pleasing way around it.  The strawberries should frame the cake and create a sense of balance.  The white plate should provide a clean, uncluttered background that complements the vibrant colors of the cake and strawberries.  The arrangement of strawberries should feel natural and not overly staged, like a relaxed and appealing presentation. The perspective should be slightly from above, creating a sense of looking down at the dessert plate.
