Generate an image of a plate of food.  The main focus is a pile of golden-brown spring rolls, varying in size and lying somewhat haphazardly.  They are slightly oily-looking, and have a crisp texture implied by their appearance.  There are at least seven visible, with possibly more underneath.  

Nestled amongst the spring rolls is a single, small egg tart. It's round, with a flaky, golden crust and a pale yellow custard filling visible inside. The egg tart is positioned slightly off-center, resting on top of some of the spring rolls.

In the background, slightly out of focus, is a small, white porcelain ramekin containing a dark brown sauce, possibly soy sauce or a similar dipping sauce.  To the far left, partially obscured by the spring rolls, are some strips of fresh carrots and green lettuce, neatly arranged.  These are less crisp and more vibrant in color compared to the fried food.

The entire scene is set on a bright white plate, with a slightly blurred, light wood background visible in the upper right corner. The lighting is relatively even, casting subtle highlights on the spring rolls and the egg tart, to emphasize their textures. The overall style should be photorealistic and appetizing.  The egg tart should be sharply in focus, while the spring rolls and background elements have a slight, natural depth of field blur.
