Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene.  The background should depict a typical suburban house with a green lawn. The house is a single-story ranch style, light brown or beige in color, with visible windows and a slightly overgrown yard.  Mature deciduous trees surround the house, providing ample shade. There's a chain link fence partially visible in the foreground separating the yard from what appears to be a neighboring property or street. The grass is short to medium length and shows some variations in color and texture, implying patches of dirt or bare ground in places. The overall lighting should suggest a somewhat overcast day.


In the foreground, place a white tiger. The tiger should be positioned slightly off-center, facing towards the viewer but angled slightly to the left. It should be standing in the grass, not overly close to the fence, approximately in the lower-center third of the overall image.  The tiger should appear realistically rendered, with distinct white fur and dark stripes. Its expression should be somewhat alert but calm.  The tiger should be large enough to be a noticeable focal point, but not so large that it overwhelms the backyard setting. The grass under and around the tiger should be slightly compressed, indicating the weight of the animal. The overall scene needs to maintain a photorealistic quality, as if the tiger truly belongs in the backyard, making it look as seamlessly integrated as possible.  No unnatural shadows or lighting discrepancies should be present.
