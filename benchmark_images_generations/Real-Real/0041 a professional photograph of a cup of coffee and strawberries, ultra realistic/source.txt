Generate a photorealistic image of a slice of tiramisu cake on a white plate surrounded by fresh strawberries.


**Scene:** The main focus is a single, generous slice of tiramisu cake.  The cake should have visible layers: a bottom layer of coffee-soaked ladyfingers, a middle layer of creamy mascarpone, and a top layer of more mascarpone, possibly with a glossy finish.  A dark coffee bean or chocolate garnish is visible on the top. The cake looks moist and rich. Around the cake are several fresh, ripe strawberries, arranged casually but attractively, not in a perfect pattern.  The strawberries should have varying degrees of redness and some slight highlights to show their juiciness.

**Lighting:** The lighting is soft and diffused, preventing harsh shadows. The scene is well-lit, with a subtle highlight on the glossy top of the cake and on the strawberries.  The light source seems to be soft and slightly above the plate. There is a gentle, natural-looking reflection on the plate from the cake and strawberries.

**Style:** The style is clean, simple, and elegant. The overall mood is appetizing and inviting, suggesting a delicious dessert.  The image should have a high resolution and sharp detail, allowing individual seeds in the strawberries and texture in the cake to be seen.  The background should be simple and uncluttered, perhaps a subtly blurred neutral background or a completely white background to keep the focus on the food. The overall image should have warm, slightly cool color tones.

**Composition:** The cake is slightly off-center, creating a visually appealing asymmetry. The strawberries are arranged in a semi-circle around the cake, forming a natural border.  The plate is a simple, clean white, rectangular plate which complements the food's colors and enhances its presentation. The perspective is slightly above the plate, offering a clear view of the cake and strawberries.
