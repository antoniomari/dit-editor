Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene.  The background should depict a typical suburban backyard: a grassy lawn, a chain-link fence, mature deciduous trees (mostly oak-like with full, rounded canopies) in the background, and a single-story house visible in the mid-ground.  The house should be a light-colored, possibly beige or light brown, with visible windows and a simple roofline.  The lawn should be a short, even green, with patches of slightly lighter green suggesting variation in sunlight exposure. The lighting should suggest a slightly overcast day.

In the foreground, place a small, fluffy dog. The dog should be a mostly white Jack Russell Terrier mix, with distinctive black patches on its head and back. It's positioned slightly off-center, facing to the left, and appears to be standing on a slightly more sandy/dry patch of ground near the edge of the lawn.  The dog should have a somewhat playful, alert expression.

The dog should be sharply in focus, contrasting with a slightly softer focus on the background elements. The overall tone should be peaceful and natural. The dog should not appear digitally pasted; it should look naturally integrated into the scene as if it were genuinely present in the backyard.  The color palette should be relatively muted and natural, with greens, browns, and the off-white and black of the dog as the dominant colors.
