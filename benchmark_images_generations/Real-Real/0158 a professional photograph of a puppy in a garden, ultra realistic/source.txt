Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene on a slightly overcast day.  The style should be photorealistic, with natural color tones and a slightly muted palette.

The scene should include:

* **Foreground:**  A patch of dry, light beige-tan dirt or sandy soil, sparsely dotted with small, light green weeds or grass. This occupies roughly the bottom third of the image.

* **Midground:** A large expanse of bright, even green lawn grass. This fills most of the frame between the foreground and background. The grass appears well-maintained but not perfectly manicured, showing subtle variations in tone and texture.

* **Background:**  A single-story, light brown or beige house with a dark brown roof. It sits slightly back from the viewer. The house appears modestly sized and somewhat simple in design. To the left of the house, a partially visible green fence and the top of a smaller structure are seen. Lush green deciduous trees surround the house, with branches partially overlapping the house. A chain-link fence runs along the left side of the yard.  There might be hints of some shrubs and smaller plants bordering the house and fence.

**Lighting:** The lighting should be soft and diffused, indicative of an overcast day. There should be no harsh shadows. The light should be even across the scene, with subtle variations to provide depth and texture.

**Composition:** The composition should be a simple, slightly elevated viewpoint looking towards the house from a perspective within the yard.  The scene should be largely symmetrical, with the house positioned centrally, though not necessarily perfectly so.  The focus should be on the expanse of the lawn leading to the house and trees.  There should be a sense of calm and quiet.
