Generate a photorealistic image of a student's desk situated next to a window in a dorm room. The scene is lit by a flexible desk lamp positioned above an open textbook, casting a warm, slightly diffused glow on the desk's surface.

**Scene:**

* The desk is a simple, dark brown wooden desk with visible scratches and wear, indicating regular use. It's cluttered but organized: an open textbook lies near the center, illuminated by the lamp; a small, cylindrical object (possibly a speaker or water bottle) sits to the right; a cell phone and earphones are scattered nearby; and a computer monitor (a flat screen style, white and possibly a Mac) is positioned on the desk towards the back right.
* A black mesh office chair is partially visible in the foreground, facing the desk. It appears comfortable and well-worn. Beside the chair, a part of another, lighter wooden chair is visible, suggesting a shared space.  
* A window is visible on the left wall, showing an outdoor scene with blurry details of buildings, suggesting an urban setting. The window has a white frame and allows some natural light to enter the room.
* A section of a textured wall with stripes of yellow, orange, and blue is visible behind the desk, giving the impression of a dorm room or shared living space.

**Lighting:**

* The primary light source is the desk lamp, which illuminates the textbook and surrounding area with a soft, warm light. The light source should be metallic silver in tone.
* Natural light from the window provides soft, ambient lighting, slightly illuminating the wall and the room. The overall lighting should be relatively soft and not overly bright or harsh.

**Style:**

* The style should be photorealistic, with a focus on details and textures.  The image should have a slightly muted color palette, with the warm light from the lamp as a key element.  The overall feel should be one of quiet study or work.
* The image should avoid overly stylized or artificial elements, aiming for a natural, candid look.

**Composition:**

* The desk should be angled slightly towards the viewer, offering a slightly high angle perspective. The composition should be relatively close to the desk, focusing on the details of the work area.  The chair is in the foreground to provide a sense of scale. The window helps give context of the space and acts as a background element.

The overall image should evoke a sense of calm concentration and the quiet routine of a student at work.
