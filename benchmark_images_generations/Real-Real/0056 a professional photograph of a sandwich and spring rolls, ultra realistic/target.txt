Generate an image of a plate of food containing several spring rolls and a small bowl of dipping sauce.  In the foreground, and partially obscuring some of the spring rolls, is a double-decker sandwich.  The sandwich appears to be made of two slices of toasted whole-wheat bread with a scrambled egg filling. The sandwich is positioned slightly off-center, with a slight overlap onto the spring rolls in the lower-right. The spring rolls are golden brown and slightly oily-looking, arranged somewhat haphazardly on the plate. A small white ceramic bowl containing a dark reddish-brown dipping sauce is situated behind the spring rolls and slightly offset to the left.  A garnish of shredded carrots and lettuce is placed at the far-left of the plate behind the spring rolls. The overall lighting is soft and even, with a slight warm tone. The plate is white and slightly reflective. The background is blurred but suggests a light-colored tabletop. The emphasis should be on the contrast between the crispness of the spring rolls and the soft texture of the egg sandwich.  The sandwich should have a slightly rustic look to it, not perfectly symmetrical. The egg filling should be visible between the layers of bread.
