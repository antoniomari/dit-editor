Generate an image of a close-up shot of a plate of crispy spring rolls arranged artfully.  The spring rolls should have a golden-brown, slightly unevenly textured surface, suggesting they've been freshly fried.  Some are partially overlapping others.  A small white ramekin filled with a dark, reddish-brown dipping sauce is nestled amongst them. To one side, a small pile of shredded carrots and bright green lettuce provides a vibrant color contrast.

The lighting should be soft and warm, with a slight highlight on the spring rolls to emphasize their texture. The overall style should be photorealistic, aiming for a clean, appetizing aesthetic reminiscent of food photography in a restaurant setting. The white plate should be slightly glossy and reflect a little of the surrounding light. The background is blurred and out of focus, suggesting a shallow depth of field. The overall composition is slightly off-center, with the spring rolls taking up most of the foreground. The background color is a warm, neutral tone, perhaps a light beige or wood tone.  Focus should be sharpest on the spring rolls in the foreground.
