Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene on a slightly overcast day.  The style should be photorealistic, with a slightly muted color palette.

**Scene:** The main focus is a large, mostly flat, expanse of bright green grass occupying the majority of the foreground and midground.  This lawn is bordered at the far edge by a chain-link fence. Beyond the fence, a single-story ranch-style house is visible. The house is light brown or beige with a dark brown roof.  It's somewhat simple in design, without ornate details.  There are mature deciduous trees of various sizes and shades of green surrounding the house and extending to the edges of the frame, creating a somewhat secluded feel.  Near the house and partially obscured by trees and greenery, there are hints of other structures and some outdoor objects (like a grill or small shed) barely visible.  In the immediate foreground, a thin band of light brown, sandy or dry dirt is present before the lush green grass begins.  The overall impression should be of a relatively well-maintained, yet somewhat unkempt, suburban backyard.

**Lighting:** The lighting should be soft and diffused, characteristic of an overcast sky. There are no harsh shadows, and the light is evenly distributed across the scene.  The overall mood should be calm and tranquil.

**Composition:** The image should be a wide shot, emphasizing the spaciousness of the lawn. The house should be positioned slightly off-center, creating visual interest. The perspective should be from a slightly low angle, as if the viewer is standing in the front yard looking towards the back.  The trees should frame the house and the lawn, adding depth and context to the scene.

**Overall:** The image should convey a sense of quiet suburban tranquility and evoke the feeling of a peaceful, relatively private backyard. The overall feel should be realistic and natural, not overly stylized or dramatic.  The colors should be realistic representations of natural greens, browns, and beiges, slightly desaturated to match the overall muted lighting.
