Generate an image of a slightly worn, light brown teddy bear sitting on a rocky outcrop.  The bear should be positioned slightly off-center, looking towards a distant landscape.

**Scene:** The bear sits amidst a collection of grey and brown rocks of varying sizes, some appearing weathered and possibly ancient. The rocks are spread across the foreground, creating a sense of texture and depth.  The background features a wide expanse of hilly landscape under a bright, clear blue sky.  The hills are a muted green and brown, somewhat dry-looking, and possibly showing signs of erosion or rocky formations, possibly cliffs, in the middle ground. There's a hint of sparse vegetation.

**Lighting:** The scene is brightly lit, suggestive of a sunny day. The light is natural and even, casting few strong shadows.  The bear itself is evenly lit, without harsh highlights or shadows.

**Style:** The overall style should be photorealistic, aiming for a slightly vintage or documentary feel. The image should have a natural and slightly rugged aesthetic, reflecting the harshness of the landscape. The color palette is predominantly natural earth tones â€“ browns, greys, greens, and the clear blue of the sky. The focus should be sharp on the bear and the immediate foreground rocks, with the background slightly softer in focus.

**Composition:** The bear acts as the focal point, drawing the viewer's eye. The rocks in the foreground lead the eye toward the bear and then to the expansive background landscape, creating a clear sense of depth and perspective.  A small portion of a low stone wall or ruin is visible to the left of the bear in the mid-ground. The horizon line should be approximately one-third of the way up from the bottom of the frame.

**Additional Details:** The teddy bear has a small, dark blue or black detail near its neck, possibly a tag or ribbon. The sky should be devoid of clouds or almost cloudless. The overall mood should be peaceful yet slightly lonely or adventurous.
