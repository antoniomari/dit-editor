Generate an image of a rocky, mountainous landscape under a clear blue sky.  The background should be a wide shot of a dry, somewhat barren landscape with rolling hills and rocky outcroppings. The vegetation is sparse, appearing dry and brownish-green.  The sky is a vibrant, cloudless blue.

In the foreground, positioned on the rocky terrain, are two teddy bears.

* **Teddy Bear 1:** A light beige or tan teddy bear, sitting upright. It has a slightly worn appearance, and a small, light blue ribbon is around its neck. This bear is positioned slightly to the left of center, closer to the viewer.

* **Teddy Bear 2:** A darker brown teddy bear, also sitting upright, but positioned slightly to the right of center and further back in the foreground compared to the first bear.  This bear appears slightly more worn or faded than the first.

The teddy bears are placed amongst the rocks, appearing as if they've been casually placed there. There should be a sense of scale that shows the bears are relatively small compared to the vastness of the background landscape.  The rocks are various shades of grey and brown, rough in texture, with some appearing larger than others.  The overall lighting should suggest a sunny day with strong, even lighting.

The composition should emphasize the juxtaposition between the softness of the teddy bears and the harshness of the rocky landscape, creating a slightly surreal or whimsical scene. The bears should appear as if they are observing the landscape. No other objects should be included aside from the bears and the natural landscape.
