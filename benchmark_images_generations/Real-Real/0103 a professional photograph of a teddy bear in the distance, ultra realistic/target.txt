Generate an image of a rocky, mountainous landscape under a clear blue sky.  The background should be a wide shot of a dry, hilly terrain, possibly in a desert or steppe climate. The hills are a muted brownish-green, with sparse vegetation. The sky should be a vibrant, cloudless blue.


In the foreground, place two teddy bears.

* **Teddy Bear 1:** A light tan or beige teddy bear with reddish-orange paw pads. This bear is positioned slightly to the left of center and is seated, appearing slightly smaller than Teddy Bear 2. It has a slightly worn or vintage look.

* **Teddy Bear 2:** A medium brown teddy bear, seated slightly to the right of the first bear and oriented slightly to the right.  This bear is slightly larger than Teddy Bear 1, and also appears slightly worn.  It should have a small, dark blue detail (possibly a tag or a small ribbon) around its neck.

Both teddy bears are situated amongst grey and brown rocks of varying sizes, as if they've been placed there naturally but are clearly not part of the natural landscape.  The rocks should have a rough texture and be somewhat unevenly distributed, showing some gaps of sand or earth between them.  The bears should be relatively close together but not touching, with enough space to distinguish both of them clearly.  The scene should be lit naturally, with the sun high in the sky casting even lighting on both the bears and the background. The overall effect should be one of whimsical contrast between the soft teddy bears and the harsh, rugged landscape.
