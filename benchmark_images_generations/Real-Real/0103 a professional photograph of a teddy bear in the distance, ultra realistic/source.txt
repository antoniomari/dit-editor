Generate an image of a slightly worn, light brown teddy bear sitting on a rocky outcrop.  The bear is facing to the right of the frame, its head turned slightly to look out over a landscape.  It has a small, dark blue tag or ribbon around its neck.  The bear is somewhat realistically textured, not overly smooth or plush-looking.

The rocky outcrop is composed of light gray and brown stones, some large and angular, others smaller and more fragmented. There are a few scattered reddish-brown stones amongst them that appear to be a different type of rock. The rocks look weathered and dry, suggesting a warm climate.

The background is a vast, sun-drenched landscape.  A range of low, rolling hills stretches into the distance under a clear blue sky. The hills are a mix of greens and browns, showing some sparse vegetation.  A slightly darker line of cliffs or rock formations is visible in the mid-ground, separating the closer hills from the more distant ones. The overall lighting is bright and sunny, with hard shadows cast by the rocks.

The style should be photorealistic, capturing the details of the bear's texture and the ruggedness of the stones. The overall composition should feel peaceful and slightly lonely, emphasizing the bear's solitary position overlooking the expansive landscape. The depth of field should be shallow enough to keep the focus clearly on the bear, softly blurring the background.  A pale white flagpole is visible on the left side of the image, in the distance, a barely noticeable detail. The image should evoke a sense of quiet adventure and solitude.
