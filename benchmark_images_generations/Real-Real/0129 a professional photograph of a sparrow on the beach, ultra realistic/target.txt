Generate an image of a tranquil waterfront scene at sunset.  The background should feature a long, modern bridge spanning a wide body of water.  The bridge should have multiple spans and appear sturdy, with its silhouette outlined against a sunset sky.  In the background, beyond the bridge,  a cityscape should be visible, featuring several tall buildings, including a prominent high-rise building to the right that is rectangular and relatively plain. The sky should be a mix of soft pastel colors—pinks, oranges, and purples—near the horizon, gradually transitioning to deeper blues and grays higher up, with some dramatic cloud formations.  The water should be relatively calm, reflecting the colors of the sky and the bridge.

In the foreground, place a small bird, specifically a sparrow or a similar small brown and white bird, perched on a sandy beach or shoreline. The bird should be positioned slightly off-center, approximately one-third of the way up from the bottom of the frame.  The bird should appear somewhat relaxed or at rest, focusing on the detailed plumage and texture of its feathers. The sand should be a muted brown-gray color, relatively even in texture, with only subtle variations to create a natural look. The bird should not appear jarring or overly imposed but rather integrated into the scene as if it were naturally present.  The overall lighting should be soft and harmonious, consistent with a natural sunset glow, subtly illuminating both the bird and the surrounding landscape.  The overall mood of the image should be serene and peaceful.
