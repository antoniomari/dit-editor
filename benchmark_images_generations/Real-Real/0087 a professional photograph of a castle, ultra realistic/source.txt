Generate an image of a portion of a suspension bridge, specifically focusing on a central tower and a section of the roadway.  The bridge should be a dark grayish-blue steel color, with a slightly weathered or aged look. The suspension cables are numerous and tightly spaced, running from the tower to the far sides of the visible bridge section.  The roadway is detailed, showing the steel grating and structure beneath.  The tower itself is tall and imposing, featuring a slightly ornate top section.

The scene is set on a calm day, with a light haze or mist giving the background a slightly muted appearance.  The lighting should be bright but diffuse, a soft, even light that avoids harsh shadows.  The sky should be a clear, light gray or pale blue, almost featureless.

In the background, a city skyline is visible through the bridge's structure. This skyline should be relatively distant and somewhat desaturated in color, consisting of various buildings of varying heights, showing a mix of architectural styles. The buildings should be largely muted grays and blues. A smaller bridge is partially visible in the far background to the left. The water below the bridge is a calm, slightly darker shade of blue, relatively flat and showing only minimal texture.

The overall style should be realistic, aiming for a slightly documentary or journalistic feel.  The composition should emphasize the bridge's structure and its relationship to the urban landscape, with the bridge dominating the foreground and the city skyline providing a contrasting background element. The color palette is subdued, with blues and grays as the primary colors. The aspect ratio should be approximately landscape oriented.
