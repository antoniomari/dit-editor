Generate an image of a tranquil waterfront scene at sunset.  The style should be realistic, with a slightly muted and desaturated color palette, evoking a calm and peaceful atmosphere.

The main focus is a long, low-lying bridge spanning a calm body of water. The bridge should be dark grey or black in silhouette against the sky. The water should be relatively still, reflecting the sky and the bridge subtly.  A sandy beach occupies the foreground, extending from the bottom third of the image to the water's edge. The sand should be a medium-grey, with small pebbles and scattered debris visible in a shallow depth of field, focusing attention on the midground and background.

In the background, beyond the bridge, is a cityscape with a prominent, tall, rectangular building, possibly a hotel or office tower, that is dark and relatively simple in design.  A few other, smaller buildings should be visible in the distance.

The sky is a dramatic mix of clouds. The upper portion of the sky should be a deep, slightly bluish-grey, with lighter, more pastel-toned clouds—pink, light orange, and yellow—concentrated towards the horizon near the sunset. The clouds should be fluffy and somewhat textured but not overly dramatic or stormy. The lighting should be soft, mimicking the soft light of a sunset, with the sun mostly obscured by clouds.  The overall lighting should be evenly balanced, avoiding harsh shadows.

The overall composition should be wide, emphasizing the vastness of the sky and water. The bridge acts as a clear dividing line between the foreground beach and the background cityscape.  The image should have a slightly long exposure effect on the water, showing a slight blur to the water's surface, contributing to the sense of calm.
