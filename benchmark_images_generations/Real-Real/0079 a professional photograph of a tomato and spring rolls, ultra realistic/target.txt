Generate an image of a white plate containing several golden-brown spring rolls arranged somewhat haphazardly.  The spring rolls are slightly uneven in size and shape, suggesting they're handmade.  They're mostly clustered towards the center of the plate, leaving some empty space around the edges.  A small, white ramekin of dark reddish-brown sauce sits behind and slightly to the left of the main spring roll cluster. To the upper left of the ramekin, a small mound of shredded carrots and green lettuce is visible, adding a fresh, contrasting element.

In the bottom right quadrant of the plate, add a single, ripe red tomato.  It should be large and round and placed slightly overlapping some of the lower spring rolls. The tomato's smooth skin and subtle highlights should contrast with the crispy texture implied by the spring rolls.  The lighting should be soft and even, highlighting the textures and colors of both the food and the plate. The overall style should be similar to food photography, emphasizing appetizing visuals.
