Generate an image of a beach scene at sunset, focusing on a long bridge spanning a body of water.  The sky is a dramatic blend of sunset oranges and pinks fading into cooler blues and grays. Clouds are abundant, with a mix of fluffy and darker, more textured clouds.

In the background, across the water, sits a long, multi-span bridge. The bridge is dark gray or black, with visible supports and lanes for traffic.  The bridge appears to be relatively modern in design.  Behind the bridge, and slightly to the right, is a city skyline, relatively low-rise except for a distinct, newly added building. This building is a modern high-rise with a unique, irregular shape, possibly with setbacks or unusual angles; it is predominantly white or light-colored.  The overall feel of the city skyline is one of calm sophistication.

The foreground is a sandy beach with small pebbles or grains of sand that extend to the water's edge.  The sand is dark and has a natural texture. The water is calm, reflecting the sky and bridge faintly.  The overall lighting should match the sunset, with warm light on the beach and cooler tones reflecting on the water. The perspective should be from a low point of view, near the beach, providing a wide view of the bridge and cityscape in the background.  The added building should be integrated seamlessly, as if it naturally belongs in the city skyline.  Avoid any obvious seams or artifacts that would indicate the photo manipulation.  The image should maintain a consistent level of realism and photo quality throughout.
