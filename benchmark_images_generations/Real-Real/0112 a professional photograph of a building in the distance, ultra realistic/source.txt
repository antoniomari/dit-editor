Generate an image of a tranquil waterfront scene at sunset or sunrise. 


**Scene:** The main focus is a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water.  The bridge is a muted grey-toned color, with subtle architectural details visible but not overly prominent.  On the far side of the bridge, a cityscape is visible, including a prominent, dark-colored, high-rise building and a few smaller buildings. The buildings are silhouetted against the sky. The foreground is a sandy beach, textured and coarse, extending from the bottom third of the image towards the water. There are a few small boats visible near the bridge.


**Lighting:** The light should be soft and diffused, suggesting either a sunset or sunrise.  The sky is a mix of soft pastel colors (pale pinks, oranges, and yellows near the horizon, transitioning to deeper blues and purples higher up) with dramatic clouds that are darker towards the top and lighter near the horizon.  The overall lighting creates a peaceful, slightly moody atmosphere. The bridge and cityscape are relatively dark silhouettes against the brighter sky.  There is a subtle reflection of the sky and bridge on the water.


**Style:** The style should be photorealistic with a slightly muted color palette. The image should have a calm and serene quality. The perspective should be from a low angle on the sandy beach, looking towards the bridge and cityscape. Aim for a cinematic or slightly melancholic feel. Long exposure is implied by the smooth texture of the water.


**Composition:** The bridge is the central element, extending horizontally across the image. The cityscape is positioned slightly off-center to the right. The sandy beach in the foreground occupies roughly one-third of the frame, leading the eye towards the bridge and the skyline. The sky should occupy a significant portion of the image, contributing to the overall mood.  The use of leading lines (the beach and the bridge) guides the viewer's eye through the scene.
