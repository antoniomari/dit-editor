Generate an image of a rocky, arid landscape under a clear blue sky.  The rocks are light grey and tan, various sizes and shapes, strewn across the ground.  Some rocks are larger, almost boulder-sized. Sparse, dry-looking vegetation is visible in crevices between the rocks. The landscape extends into the mid-ground and background showing more rocks and a distant line of low hills under the clear, bright blue sky.

In the mid-ground, slightly elevated, is a large, modern glass and steel hotel complex.  The complex is floating in the air, appearing impossibly suspended above the landscape, about a third of the way up from the bottom of the frame. It should appear surreal, like it's been digitally pasted into the scene. The hotel shows reflections of the sky and its modern architecture is clearly visible.

In the foreground, positioned slightly to the right of center, sits a plush brown teddy bear. The bear is seated, looking toward the hotel complex but not directly at it; its head slightly turned. It has a small, dark blue detail (possibly a tag or ribbon) around its neck. The bear is well-lit and has a slightly fuzzy texture. The contrast between the rough texture of the rocks and the soft texture of the teddy bear should be prominent.


The overall mood should be whimsical and slightly surreal due to the floating hotel. The color palette should be primarily warm earth tones (browns, tans, greys) contrasted by the cool tones of the glass hotel and the deep blue of the sky.  The placement of the bear emphasizes the scale difference between the miniature bear and the immense, floating structure.
