Generate an image of a slightly worn, light brown teddy bear sitting on a rocky outcrop.  The bear is facing to the right, slightly angled towards the viewer, and is looking out over a landscape.  It has a small, dark blue detail (like a tag or ribbon) around its neck.  The bear is realistically textured, showing some slight fuzziness and wear.

The outcrop is composed of various sized, grey and light brown rocks, showing signs of weathering and age. Some larger, flatter stones suggest possible remnants of a structure or wall. Smaller rocks and pebbles are scattered amongst the larger ones.  The ground shows a light sandy or dusty texture.


The background is a broad, sunny landscape.  A range of hills stretches into the distance under a clear, bright blue sky.  The hills are mostly dry-looking, a mixture of light browns and greens, suggesting sparse vegetation.  Thereâ€™s a sense of vastness and open space. A distant, low-lying range of hills can be seen.  Part of a low stone wall or ruins is visible behind the bear, implying an archaeological or historical setting.

The lighting is natural, bright, and predominantly from a high angle, casting slight shadows on the rocks and the teddy bear itself. The overall style should be photorealistic, with a slightly muted color palette emphasizing the natural earth tones. The composition should focus on the teddy bear as the central point of interest, set against the expansive background. The image should have a slightly melancholic, contemplative mood, highlighting the juxtaposition of the small, worn teddy bear in a vast, ancient landscape.
