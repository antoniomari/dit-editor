Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene.  The background should consist of a well-maintained lawn, a single-story house with a brown roof and light-colored siding, partially visible behind some mature trees.  The trees are a mix of deciduous and evergreen types, with full leafy canopies suggesting it's spring or summer. A simple chain-link fence runs along the edge of the yard, partially visible in the lower left.

In the foreground, centrally located on the lawn but slightly offset to the left, place a giant panda bear. The panda should be sitting, appearing relaxed, and actively eating a large bundle of bamboo shoots. The panda should be realistically rendered, with fur texture and detail clearly visible.  The bamboo should look fresh and green.

The panda should be positioned so that it interacts with the background in a non-intrusive way. It's not disrupting or altering the backyard scene, only adding to it; the panda should seem naturally situated in the otherwise ordinary backyard.  There should be a slight contrast between the panda's dark fur and the lighter-colored grass and soil. The lighting should be consistent with natural daylight, softly illuminating the scene overall.  The overall composition should be a whimsical juxtaposition of a seemingly out-of-place panda in a domestic setting.  The image should have a photorealistic quality.
