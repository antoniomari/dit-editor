Generate an image of a white tiger standing on a sandy shore in the foreground.  The tiger should be positioned slightly off-center, facing towards the viewer but angled slightly to its left.  It should be a life-sized, realistic depiction of a white tiger with visible stripes. The tiger should appear to be alert but calm, not aggressive.


The background should depict a cityscape at sunset or sunrise.  The sky should be a mixture of blues, purples, and oranges, with clouds adding texture and depth.  The cityscape should include a long, multi-span bridge stretching across a calm body of water.  Buildings, including a tall, relatively modern-looking building, should be visible in the distance beyond the bridge.  The water should reflect the colors of the sky. The beach where the tiger stands should be a relatively flat, sandy shoreline with small pebbles or stones mixed in.


The overall lighting should be soft and even, creating a peaceful atmosphere. The contrast between the white tiger and the muted tones of the background should be noticeable but not harsh.  The tiger should not appear superimposed; rather, it should seem naturally integrated into the scene, as if it were photographed there.  The perspective should be such that the city is in the background and doesn't dwarf the tiger; the scene should feel balanced. The overall mood should be serene and slightly surreal.
