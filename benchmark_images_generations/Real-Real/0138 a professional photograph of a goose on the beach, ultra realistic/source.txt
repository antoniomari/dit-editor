Generate an image of a tranquil waterfront scene at sunset.  The style should be photorealistic, with a slightly muted, almost melancholic color palette.

**Scene:** The main focus is a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water.  The bridge should be dark-toned, almost silhouetted against the sky.  On the far shore, a tall, rectangular building, possibly a hotel, stands prominently.  There are other smaller buildings visible in the distance, but they are less defined.  In the foreground, a gently sloping sandy beach stretches towards the water, occupying the lower third of the frame.  The sand should appear coarse-grained, possibly with small pebbles or shell fragments visible.

**Lighting:** The light is soft and diffused, characteristic of either a late sunset or early sunrise. The sky should feature a blend of pastel colors – soft pinks, oranges, and purples, particularly near the horizon – gradually transitioning to cooler blues and grays higher up. The clouds should be somewhat dramatic, with visible texture and depth, creating a sense of atmosphere. The overall lighting should be balanced to avoid harsh shadows; the scene should feel calm and peaceful. The reflection of the sky and bridge should be visible in the relatively still water.


**Composition:** The composition should be a wide shot, emphasizing the expansive nature of the sky and water.  The bridge acts as a clear leading line, guiding the viewer's eye towards the city skyline in the distance.  The foreground beach provides a strong contrast in texture, grounding the scene. The horizon line should be placed approximately one-third of the way up from the bottom of the image, adhering to the "rule of thirds."

**Overall:** The image should evoke a sense of serenity and quietude, capturing the beauty of a serene sunset over a coastal city. The mood should be contemplative and slightly atmospheric, leaning towards a calm yet slightly dramatic feeling. The image resolution should be high enough to show detail in the sand, clouds, and textures.
