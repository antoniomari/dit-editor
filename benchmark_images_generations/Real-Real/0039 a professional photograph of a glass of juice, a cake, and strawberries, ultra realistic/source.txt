Generate a photorealistic image of a slice of tiramisu cake on a white plate, surrounded by fresh strawberries.


**Scene:** The scene is a close-up shot of a single, triangular slice of tiramisu cake elegantly positioned on a clean, bright white rectangular plate.  The cake is the central focus, with fresh, ripe strawberries arranged artfully around it.  Some strawberries are whole, others are slightly out of focus creating a depth of field.


**Cake:** The tiramisu cake slice is layered, showing distinct layers of coffee-soaked ladyfingers and a creamy, light-colored mousse or custard. The top is glossy, possibly with a gelatinous glaze, and shows subtle variations in texture and color, indicating the coffee layers within.  A single dark-colored coffee bean or chocolate garnish is visible on the top of the cake.

**Strawberries:**  The strawberries are vibrant red, with a slightly glossy sheen. They exhibit subtle variations in color and shading, implying natural lighting and texture.  They're arranged casually, yet aesthetically pleasing, around the cake.  Their position implies a sense of freshness and delicacy that complements the dessert.


**Lighting:** The lighting is soft and diffused, avoiding harsh shadows. The light source appears to be soft and natural, likely from above or slightly to the side. This soft lighting accentuates the textures of the cake and the strawberries, enhancing their appealing qualities.


**Style:** The overall style should be clean, elegant, and appetizing. The image should convey a sense of freshness and high quality, with a focus on the details and textures of both the cake and the strawberries. The image should have a depth of field that keeps the focus on the cake, with the background and other strawberries slightly softer. The background should be subtly out of focus, keeping the main focus on the cake and strawberries on the plate.


**Composition:** The composition is centered around the cake slice.  The strawberries are arranged in a somewhat circular pattern, creating visual interest while not overwhelming the central subject. The plate is positioned on a barely visible, warm-toned surface, such as a wooden table, leaving the attention on the food. The image should be professionally photographed, with good lighting and focus.  The composition should be appealing and inviting, making the viewer want to taste the dessert.
