Generate an image of a grassy field, partially shaded by a coniferous tree to the left.  The grass is a light brownish-green, typical of a sunny day.  The tree's trunk is thick, brown, and textured, and its branches extend diagonally across the upper left to upper right of the frame, creating shade.

In the mid-ground, slightly to the left of center, is a grey rabbit. The rabbit is positioned in profile view, facing away from the viewer toward the right of the image, and is sitting with its ears upright. The rabbit's fur is predominantly grey, with some subtle variations in tone.  Its fur appears soft and textured.

In the mid-ground, slightly to the right of center, is a tall, slender, red fire alarm box. The box is ornate, with a decorative top and base. Itâ€™s a deep, slightly-darkened red with small, visible details indicating metal texture. A small glass window is visible at the front of the box which displays a minimal blue and red element. The box stands upright, firmly planted in the grass.  The fire alarm box is slightly taller than the rabbit.

The overall lighting suggests a bright, sunny day, with soft shadows cast by the tree. The rabbit and the fire alarm box are positioned such that the rabbit appears to be looking curiously at the alarm box. There is a sense of quiet observation in the scene; no other elements are present. The resolution should be high enough to show the detailed textures of the rabbit's fur, grass blades, and the metalwork of the fire alarm box. The image should feel natural and peaceful.
