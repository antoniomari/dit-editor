Generate an image depicting a scene of a white rectangular plate holding a dessert and several strawberries, with a small, pale pink teapot positioned centrally on the plate, partially obscuring the dessert.


**Foreground:**

* A small, pale pink teapot with a rounded body and a slightly domed lid. The teapot's handle and spout are dark-colored, possibly black or dark brown.  It appears to be made of ceramic or porcelain. The teapot rests on the plate, sitting slightly off-center but still central in the composition, directly on top of a piece of dessert.  The teapot's bottom is hidden by the dessert.


**Background:**

* A rectangular white plate forms the background. On this plate is a piece of dessert, seemingly some kind of light-colored cake or pastry, with a dark topping or glaze visible on top.  The dessert is partially hidden under the teapot.  Surrounding the dessert are several fresh strawberries arranged somewhat loosely around the teapot. The strawberries are ripe and red, varying slightly in size and shape.  Some strawberries are partially overlapping others, creating a natural, un-arranged cluster. The strawberries and dessert are situated such that they create a visual border or frame around the teapot. The light reflecting off of the plate and the dessert suggests a soft, indoor lighting condition.


**Interaction:**

The teapot is the focal point of the image, positioned to visually dominate the scene. Its placement partially obscures the underlying dessert, creating depth and interest. The strawberries are placed around the teapot and dessert, forming a visual boundary and creating a pleasing arrangement with the dessert itself.  The overall interaction suggests a still-life setup, emphasizing the juxtaposition of the teapot and the dessert, making the scene appear somewhat surreal or whimsical.


**Changes:**

The only significant change to the base background (the plate and dessert alone) is the addition of the teapot and strawberries. The teapot and the strawberries themselves are added elements; these new elements enhance the complexity of the composition and add a playful contrast between the dessert and the teapot.  The arrangement of the strawberries in relation to the teapot suggests a carefully staged scene.
