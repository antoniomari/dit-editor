Generate a high-resolution image of a scene featuring a single slice of tiramisu cake on a white square plate, surrounded by fresh strawberries.


**Scene:** The main focus is a triangular slice of tiramisu cake.  The cake should have a distinct two-layer structure, visible through a slightly translucent, glossy topping. The top layer should be a light creamy color, and the bottom layer a darker, coffee-brown color reflecting the coffee-soaked ladyfingers. There should be a visible coffee bean (or something resembling it) embedded in the glaze near the top of the slice.  The cake should appear moist and delicious.

Surrounding the cake are about eight to ten fresh strawberries, arranged somewhat casually around the cake on the plate, not in any specific pattern, some whole, some partially obscured.  The strawberries should be bright red, glossy, and realistically rendered, showcasing their texture and detail, such as the tiny seeds.

**Lighting:** The lighting should be soft and diffused, avoiding harsh shadows. The light should highlight the glossy glaze on the cake and the juicy appearance of the strawberries, creating a sense of appetizing appeal. A subtle highlight should be present on the raised portions of the cake and the strawberries to enhance their three-dimensional aspects.


**Style:**  The overall style should be photorealistic, capturing the textures and details of both the cake and strawberries with precision.  The image should feel clean and inviting, suitable for a food blog or cookbook.


**Composition:** The cake should be the central element, slightly off-center, with the strawberries arranged around it to provide balance.  The white plate provides a clean background, making the food the star of the image. The angle should be slightly elevated, giving a clear view of the cake and surrounding strawberries. The background should be a very blurry, out-of-focus light-colored background, almost white or very light beige, to keep the attention on the food.  Avoid any distracting elements. The entire scene should be contained within a clean, well-lit space, with a focus on highlighting the food's appealing qualities.
