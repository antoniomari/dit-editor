Generate an image of a rolling green hillside landscape.  The hillside is primarily composed of short, light green grass with patches of taller, slightly darker green grass and scattered wildflowers (mostly yellow, with some reddish-brown accents).  A dirt path meanders through the center of the image from the middle ground to the background, curving gently to the right as it ascends the hill.  In the background, a line of mixed deciduous trees appears on a slightly elevated portion of the hill, with taller evergreen trees behind them creating depth.  The overall lighting suggests a sunny day, with the light evenly diffused across the scene.


In the foreground, add a large eagle in flight, positioned slightly to the right of the center of the image and slightly above the level of the dirt path.  The eagle should be sharply in focus, in contrast to a slightly softer focus on the background grass. The eagle is in mid-flight, wings fully outstretched, and is oriented slightly angled to the right, heading toward the upper right corner of the image.  It's dark brown, appearing almost black from this angle, with hints of lighter brown feathers.  Its head is visible, and it's clearly a majestic bird, appearing powerful and free.  The eagle doesn't appear to be interacting directly with the ground or any other elements; it is simply superimposed on the scene. The addition of the eagle does not alter the lighting or color palette of the landscape; it simply adds a focal point. The eagle's presence adds a sense of scale and wildness to the otherwise serene countryside.
