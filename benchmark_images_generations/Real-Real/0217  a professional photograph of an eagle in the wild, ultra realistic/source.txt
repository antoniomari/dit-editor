Generate a background image depicting a sun-drenched, pastoral scene.  The style should be photorealistic, with a slightly soft focus and a gentle, hazy quality to the light.  This suggests a warm, summer day.


**Scene:** The main focus is a gently sloping grassy path that meanders from the foreground towards the middle ground, disappearing into a grove of trees. The path is light green and tan, showing some subtle textural variation indicative of packed earth and grass.  On either side of this path is taller, slightly overgrown grass and wildflowers, predominantly in light greens and yellows, with touches of red/orange in some smaller wildflowers close to the viewer. 


The middle ground features a small, dense copse of deciduous trees, with reddish-brown leaves suggesting either a particular tree variety or autumnal tinge. Beyond this grove, the background is filled with a gently rolling hillside covered in dense, dark green coniferous forest. The trees are predominantly evergreens, giving a feeling of depth and distance. The distant trees are less detailed, creating a sense of perspective.


**Lighting:** The lighting should be bright and diffused, suggesting sunlight filtering through a thin haze.  The light should be even, with minimal harsh shadows, giving a soft and idyllic quality. The light should be most intense on the path and foreground wildflowers, slightly softer on the trees and most muted on the distant forest.


**Composition:** The composition should be balanced. The path acts as a leading line, drawing the viewer's eye from the foreground to the middle ground, and then to the background forest. The composition should be somewhat symmetrical, with the vegetation on either side of the path mirroring each other in form and color, although not exactly identical. The overall feel should be one of tranquility and natural beauty.


**Overall:** The entire scene should have a peaceful, serene, and slightly dreamy quality. The slightly soft focus and hazy light enhances this feeling of tranquility, making it ideal for a background image that evokes calmness and a connection to nature. The color palette should be primarily comprised of warm greens, yellows, and soft browns, with accents of reddish-brown in the trees and muted orange-reds in the wildflower accents.
