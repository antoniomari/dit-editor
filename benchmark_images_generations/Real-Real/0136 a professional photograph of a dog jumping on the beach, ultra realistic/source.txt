Generate an image depicting a tranquil waterfront scene at either sunrise or sunset.

**Scene:** The main focus is a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water.  The bridge is relatively low to the ground, and has a slightly elevated roadway. Several supports and piers are visible beneath it.  Beyond the bridge, on the right, stands a tall, rectangular building, possibly a hotel or office building, with a slightly darker tone than the surroundings. A smaller building is visible to the right of the main building.  To the left of the bridge, there's a slightly less defined cityscape hinted at, with buildings appearing more like silhouettes. A sandy foreground beach takes up the bottom third of the image, extending to the water's edge.  The water is relatively still, with a slight reflection of the bridge and buildings.


**Lighting:** The scene is bathed in the soft, warm-toned light of either dawn or dusk.  The sky should be a mix of muted blues, pinks, and oranges, with some lingering clouds that are slightly darker and more dramatic in tone, giving a sense of atmospheric depth. The bridge itself is a silhouette against the sky. The buildings are mostly dark silhouettes as well, creating a strong contrast against the lighter sky. The foreground beach is softly lit, reflecting the ambient light.


**Style:** The overall style should be photorealistic with a slightly muted color palette, emphasizing a calm and peaceful atmosphere.  The image should have a cinematic feel, evocative of a still moment captured in a dramatic setting. Long exposure or a motion blur effect on the water might enhance the tranquility.


**Composition:** The composition should be a wide shot, with the bridge as the central element, extending across the image horizontally. The beach in the foreground provides a leading line towards the bridge and the cityscape beyond.  The sky should occupy a significant portion of the upper half of the image, creating a sense of vastness and grandeur. The balance between the beach, water, bridge and sky should convey serenity and spaciousness. The rule of thirds can be used for composition, with the horizon about a third of the way up from the bottom.
