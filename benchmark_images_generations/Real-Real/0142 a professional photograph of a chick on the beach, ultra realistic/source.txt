Generate an image of a tranquil waterfront scene at sunset. 


**Scene:** The focal point is a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water. The bridge is a muted grey-brown color, and its structure is clearly defined. In the background, a few buildings are visible, with one prominent high-rise building standing out slightly to the right. The buildings are dark silhouettes against the sky. The foreground is a gently sloping sandy beach, with a coarse texture to the sand, visible in close-up detail. The water appears relatively still, with only subtle ripples, reflecting the colors of the sky.

**Lighting:** The lighting is soft, evocative of the time just after sunset. The sky shows a blend of colors: a predominantly muted, cool blue-grey tone, with warmer shades of pink and orange visible near the horizon, hinting at the recent sunset. The lighting casts a gentle glow on the bridge and the water, subtly illuminating their shapes without harsh highlights. The buildings are mostly in shadow, adding to the dramatic effect.

**Style:** The overall style should be realistic, aiming for a photographic look and feel.  The image should have a slightly subdued, peaceful mood.  There should be a sense of depth and perspective, leading the viewer's eye from the foreground beach across the water to the bridge and buildings in the distance.  The image should be sharp, with clear details in the bridge and foreground, while the background elements can be slightly softer.

**Composition:** Use a low angle shot, emphasizing the beach in the foreground, which occupies approximately the lower third of the frame.  The bridge should be centrally located, slightly off-center to avoid perfect symmetry. The buildings provide a backdrop, adding context to the scene but not overpowering the bridge. The sky should take up a significant portion of the frame, capturing the colors of the sunset.  The focus should be on the bridge and the calm water, creating a sense of serenity.  Consider a slight motion blur on the water to suggest stillness with a hint of movement.
