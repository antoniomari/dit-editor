Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene.  The background should be a typical American suburban backyard: a well-maintained lawn, a single-story house visible in the mid-ground with mature trees surrounding it. The house is light-colored, possibly beige or light brown, with visible windows and a simple architectural style.  The lawn is a lush green, and the trees provide ample shade.  A short, metal fence runs along the edge of the property, visible on the left side.


In the foreground, centrally positioned on the lawn, is a young giant panda.  The panda is sitting, facing the camera, appearing somewhat plump and cuddly.  Itâ€™s realistically rendered, with distinct black and white markings, and its fur looks soft and fluffy. The panda should appear to be somewhat close to the viewer; there should be some visible space between the panda and the fence in the distance.  The panda should appear to slightly blend with the grass, implying it may be sitting in the grass. There's no change to the background; the panda is simply added to the existing scene.  The overall lighting is consistent, making the panda appear to belong naturally in the setting, creating a surreal but harmonious blend of the unexpected panda in the ordinary backyard.
