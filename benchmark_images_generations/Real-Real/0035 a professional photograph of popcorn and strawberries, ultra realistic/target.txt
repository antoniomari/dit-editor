Generate an image of a white plate holding a slice of cheesecake and several fresh strawberries. The cheesecake is positioned slightly off-center, towards the top.  A large mound of popcorn is digitally superimposed onto the cheesecake, obscuring most of its surface but leaving the edges of the cheesecake visible.  The popcorn should appear realistically textured and light in color, resembling a fluffy cloud nestled onto the dessert.

The strawberries are arranged around the cheesecake and popcorn, creating a circular pattern, and vary slightly in size and ripeness, adding visual interest. The strawberries should appear fresh and glossy, with visible seeds and a realistic red hue.  The overall lighting is soft and diffused, highlighting the textures and colors of the food items. The plate should be a classic white, slightly reflective, and clean, complementing the bright colors of the food. The background is slightly blurred and out-of-focus, implying a shallow depth of field and drawing attention to the food on the plate. There should be no other significant elements in the background beyond a subtle suggestion of a neutral, light-colored wall or surface.
