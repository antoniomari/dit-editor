Generate a photorealistic image of a delicious-looking tiramisu cake slice presented on a white plate.  The slice should be a generous portion, showing clearly two distinct layers of coffee-soaked ladyfingers and a creamy mascarpone filling. The top is coated in a glossy, transparent glaze, possibly with a hint of a coffee bean or similar decoration visible. The colors should be warm and inviting, with the creamy white of the mascarpone contrasting beautifully against the rich brown of the ladyfingers.  The glaze should have a subtle sheen reflecting a soft light source.

Surrounding the cake slice are several fresh, ripe strawberries, their bright red color popping against the white plate. The strawberries should be arranged artfully, but naturally, not perfectly symmetrical. Some strawberries should be slightly out of focus for depth of field.

The lighting should be soft and diffused, avoiding harsh shadows. The overall style should be clean and elegant, suggesting a high-quality dessert presentation. The plate is simple, white, and slightly reflective, enhancing the vibrancy of the colors. The background should be a simple, uncluttered, light-colored surface, perhaps a muted off-white or light beige, so the focus remains firmly on the cake and strawberries.  The composition should center the cake slice, with the strawberries artfully arranged around it, forming a pleasing visual balance.  The image should have a shallow depth of field, with the focus primarily on the cake and the strawberries immediately surrounding it.
