Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene.  The background should depict a typical suburban backyard: a neatly mown lawn, a single-story house with a brown roof visible beyond a chain-link fence.  Mature, leafy trees frame the house and line the property's edge. The lawn is a vibrant, even green, slightly lighter in color nearer the camera.  A patch of bare, light brown earth is visible in the foreground.

In the foreground, approximately one-third of the way up from the bottom and slightly off-center, place a single, fluffy yellow duckling. The duckling should be facing to the right of the frame, slightly angled. It should appear lifelike and realistically rendered, showing fine details in its downy feathers.

The duckling is positioned so that it appears to be perched on the edge of the lawn, slightly elevated, with its feet resting just at the border between the mown grass and the patch of bare earth.  The grass under and around it should be slightly disturbed, as if it had just landed.

The overall lighting should be consistent with a sunny day, casting soft shadows.  The color palette should be natural and realistic, maintaining the existing color tones of the background image while integrating the duckling seamlessly. The image should not appear digitally manipulated or jarring; the duckling should feel like a natural addition to the scene.
