Generate a photorealistic image depicting a suburban backyard scene on an overcast day. 


**Scene:** The main focus is a large, verdant lawn stretching from the foreground to a mid-ground where a single-story ranch-style house is situated.  The house is light-brown or beige, with a simple, slightly gabled roof.  It appears to have several windows and a relatively modest size.  Behind the house, there's a line of mature, leafy deciduous trees, suggesting a quiet residential neighborhood. To the left, a portion of a wooden fence is visible, and there's a hint of another house's roofline peeking through the trees in the distance.  The foreground features a strip of lighter-colored, sparsely vegetated ground, possibly sandy or dry soil.

**Lighting:** The lighting should mimic a slightly overcast day.  The scene is evenly lit, with soft, diffused light, eliminating harsh shadows. There are no bright highlights, and the overall tone should be calm and subdued. The light is primarily coming from above, suggesting the sun is somewhat hidden behind clouds.


**Style:** The style should be photorealistic, capturing fine details such as individual blades of grass, the texture of the bark on the trees, and the slight variations in color within the grass. The overall feel should be natural and un-staged, as if it's a candid shot of a typical suburban backyard.


**Composition:** The composition should use a slightly low angle, placing the viewer at ground level, looking towards the house.  The horizontal line of the house and fence provides a natural break in the image's composition, dividing the foreground from the mid and background. The deep depth of field allows for both the foreground and background details to remain sharp. The trees in the background should offer a sense of enclosure and tranquility.  The overall feeling should be peaceful and slightly melancholic due to the overcast sky.
