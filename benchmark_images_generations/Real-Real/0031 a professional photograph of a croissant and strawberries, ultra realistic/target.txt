Generate an image of a white plate holding a dessert arrangement.  The plate is slightly angled, showing a wider view of the dessert and surrounding strawberries.

The main focus is a large, golden-brown croissant, seemingly freshly baked, placed centrally on the plate. Its surface has a glossy sheen, indicating butter or glaze. The croissant is positioned slightly diagonally, partially overlapping a slice of layered cake that is beneath it.  The cake appears light-colored with visible layers, possibly a tiramisu or similar dessert. A small dark dot, possibly a coffee bean or chocolate piece, is visible on top of the cake, just behind the croissant.


The croissant and cake are surrounded by fresh strawberries. These are arranged in a somewhat loose, irregular pattern around the pastry, partially overlapping each other and the edge of the plate. The strawberries are a vibrant, deep red with visible seeds.  Some strawberries are placed directly below the croissant, others are distributed around the edges of the pastry and cake, filling the remaining space on the plate.

The overall lighting is soft and even, creating a natural and appetizing presentation.  The background should be blurred and out of focus, suggesting a simple, clean background without distracting elements. The overall style should be clean and realistic, focusing on the texture and color of the food items.  The plate should be slightly reflective, showcasing the glossy texture of the croissant and strawberries.
