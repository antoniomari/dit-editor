Generate an image depicting a tranquil waterfront scene at sunset.

**Background:** The background should feature a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water.  The bridge should be a dark gray or black, with visible supports and road lanes.  Behind the bridge, a city skyline should be visible, with buildings rendered in dark silhouettes against a vibrant sunset sky. The sky should be a mix of pastel pinks and oranges near the horizon, gradually transitioning to deeper blues and purples higher up. The clouds should be fluffy and textured, suggesting a calm but dramatic sunset.  The water reflecting the sky and bridge should appear smooth, with subtle ripples.


**Foreground:** In the foreground, a single, vibrant pink water lily (Nymphaea) should be positioned in the center of the image, resting gently on a dark, sandy beach. The water lily should be sharply in focus, contrasting with the slightly softer focus of the background. The beach should be a relatively flat, dark-colored sand, possibly with small pebbles or granules visible.


**Interaction:** The water lily should be positioned near the shoreline, creating a sense of serene contrast between the peaceful flower and the bustling city reflected in the water in the background. The reflection of the city skyline should be visible in the water near the shoreline. The overall effect should create a sense of peaceful solitude, where the small flower is a focal point of tranquility against the urban backdrop. The lighting should be consistent, with a warm, soft light emanating from the sunset, subtly illuminating the water lily. There should be a clear separation between the beach and the water, with a subtle, smooth transition.

The overall image should have a slightly muted, almost painterly quality, with soft contrasts between light and shadow. The color palette should lean towards cool tones (blues, purples) in the sky and water, with a pop of warmth from the pink of the water lily and the sunset hues.
