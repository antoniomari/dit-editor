Generate a photorealistic image of a slice of tiramisu cake on a white rectangular plate, surrounded by fresh strawberries.


**Scene:** The main focus is a single, generously sized slice of tiramisu.  The tiramisu should have a distinct, glossy, almost gelatinous top layer, showing a hint of coffee-colored liquid underneath. The cake itself is layered, with visible espresso-soaked ladyfingers and a creamy, light-colored filling. A single dark coffee bean or chocolate speck is visible on the glossy top. The slice is positioned slightly off-center, leaving more space on the right of the plate.

Around the tiramisu, fresh strawberries are arranged artfully, not in a perfect pattern but with a slightly casual and natural scattering.  Some strawberries are whole, others are slightly overlapped.  The strawberries are vibrant red, with visible seeds and a glossy sheen, indicative of freshness.

**Lighting:** The lighting is soft and diffused, avoiding harsh shadows.  There should be a subtle highlight on the glossy top of the tiramisu and the strawberries, giving them a moist and appealing look. The overall lighting should create a warm and inviting atmosphere, suitable for a dessert presentation.

**Style:** The style should be clean, simple, and elegant.  The image should feel inviting and appetizing, showcasing the textures and colors of the food beautifully.  The background should be very subtly out of focus, possibly a plain, light-colored wall or table, to keep the focus entirely on the cake and strawberries.

**Composition:** The composition is arranged to emphasize the tiramisu slice as the central element.  The strawberries are used to frame and complement the cake without overwhelming it. The white plate provides a clean, neutral background that contrasts nicely with the rich colors of the dessert and strawberries. The overall perspective is slightly elevated, looking down at the plate at a comfortable angle.  The plate should not take up the entire frame; leave some space around the edges.
