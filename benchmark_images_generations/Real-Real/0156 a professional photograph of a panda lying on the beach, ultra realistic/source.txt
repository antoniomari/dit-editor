Generate an image of a tranquil waterfront scene at sunset.

**Scene:** The main focus is a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water.  The bridge is light gray or concrete-colored, with distinct support pillars visible.  On the far side of the bridge is a cityscape featuring a prominent, dark, rectangular high-rise building. Other buildings are visible, but less distinct.  In the foreground is a beach or shoreline composed of dark, coarse sand or small pebbles. The water is relatively still, reflecting the sky and the bridge faintly.  There are a few small, indistinct boats or objects visible near the bridge on the water.

**Lighting:** The lighting is characteristic of a sunset or just after sunset. The sky should have a mixture of colors: predominantly soft blues and grays, transitioning to warmer tones of oranges and yellows near the horizon.  The clouds should be somewhat dramatic, with some areas darker and thicker than others. The overall lighting should be soft and diffused, avoiding harsh shadows. The sun itself should not be directly visible, but its presence should be implied by the warm colors in the sky. The bridge and cityscape are silhouetted against the sky.

**Style:** The overall style should be realistic, leaning slightly towards a slightly stylized, almost painterly look. The colors should be slightly muted and not overly saturated, aiming for a serene and contemplative mood. The perspective should be from a low vantage point, near the beach in the foreground, looking across the water towards the bridge and cityscape.

**Composition:** The bridge should occupy a significant portion of the middle ground, acting as a strong horizontal element. The cityscape should be placed on the right side of the frame, balanced by the expanse of the beach and water in the foreground. The sky should occupy about one third to one half of the upper portion of the frame.  The foreground should be sharply focused, with the background slightly softer, giving a sense of depth.  A subtle motion blur on the water will enhance the calm and peaceful atmosphere.
