Generate an image depicting a serene waterfront scene at sunset. The background should feature a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water.  The water should be relatively still, reflecting the colors of the sunset.  Buildings line the far shore, relatively low profile, suggesting a city or town. The sky should be a mix of muted oranges, purples, and blues, with clouds indicative of either sunrise or sunset.  The overall lighting should be soft and diffused.

In the foreground,  place a large eagle in flight, approximately positioned in the lower middle third of the frame.  The eagle should be in sharp focus, contrasting slightly with a slightly softer focus on the background. The eagle should be positioned so that it appears to be flying low over the water, toward the viewer but slightly angled away.  It should be a realistic depiction of a large eagle, with detailed feathers and a discernible head and beak.  The eagle’s position should be such that it does not obscure any significant portion of the bridge or waterfront buildings but rather enhances the overall feeling of spaciousness. The eagle should appear to be in motion, with its wings slightly angled.

The overall effect should be a tranquil scene imbued with a sense of freedom and wildness, the eagle juxtaposed against the man-made structures of the city. The color palette of the eagle should blend somewhat with the overall sunset tones.  The sandy beach in the immediate foreground should be a dark grayish-brown and relatively smooth, extending from the water’s edge up to the lower third of the image. The beach's texture should be visible but not distracting.
