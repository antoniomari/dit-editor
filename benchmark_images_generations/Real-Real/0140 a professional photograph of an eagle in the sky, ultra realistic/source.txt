Generate an image depicting a tranquil waterfront scene at sunset.

**Scene:** The main focus is a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water.  The bridge is relatively low to the water, with visible supports and a flat, wide deck. Behind the bridge, a cityscape is visible, featuring a prominent, slightly older high-rise building, with a few other, smaller buildings.  The cityscape is relatively low-rise, not a dense skyline. In the foreground, there's a sandy beach or shoreline, extending from the bottom of the image towards the water.  The sand appears coarse-grained and slightly damp. A few small boats or vessels are subtly visible near the bridge, but not the primary focus.

**Lighting:** The scene is bathed in the soft, warm light of a sunset.  The sky shows a blend of colors: pale oranges and yellows near the horizon, gradually transitioning to muted blues and purples higher up. There are some fluffy clouds scattered across the sky, adding texture and depth. The lighting should be slightly diffused, avoiding harsh shadows. The water reflects the colors of the sky subtly, with a calm and smooth surface, possibly hinting at slight motion blur to show the quiet movement of the water.

**Style:** The overall style should be realistic, aiming for a photorealistic rendering with a slightly cinematic feel. The colors should be slightly muted and natural, not overly saturated or vibrant. The scene should have a peaceful, serene mood.  The perspective should be from a low vantage point, close to the sandy shoreline, making the bridge and cityscape appear expansive.

**Composition:** The image should be horizontally oriented, with the bridge as a prominent horizontal element across the middle ground. The foreground sand should take up approximately a third of the image at the bottom, leading the eye towards the bridge and the cityscape in the background. The sky should occupy a considerable portion of the upper third, with the cityscape positioned centrally in the midground. The entire composition aims for a balanced yet dynamic composition, with the leading lines of the bridge directing the viewer's eye across the scene.  The color palette should be primarily cool, with the warmth of the sunset acting as a counterpoint.
