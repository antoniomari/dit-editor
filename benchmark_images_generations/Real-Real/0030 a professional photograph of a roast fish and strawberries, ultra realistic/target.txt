Generate an image of a white square plate containing a slice of creamy, layered dessert and a roasted whole fish. 


The dessert, positioned slightly behind and to the left of the fish, appears to be a mousse or cake with visible layers. It's light beige in color, with a subtle glaze or topping that shows some darker, reddish-brown marbling. A small, dark-colored berry or decoration is visible on its surface.


The roasted fish is the central focus, lying almost horizontally across the plate, partially overlapping the dessert. The fish is fully cooked, exhibiting a browned and crispy exterior.  It's a light brown to grayish color, with darker areas where it's browned most. The details of the fish's texture and scales should be visible. The fish's tail extends towards the upper right corner.  The fish appears to be partially behind the cake as well as partly in front, indicating overlap.


Surrounding the dessert and fish are several fresh strawberries, arranged somewhat casually around the main elements. The strawberries are bright red, and their texture should be rendered realistically.


The overall lighting of the scene should be relatively even, with no harsh shadows, giving the image a clean and appetizing feel. The plate is pristine white, enhancing the contrast of the colorful food.  The combination of the sweet dessert and the savory fish is unconventional, and this incongruity should be apparent.
