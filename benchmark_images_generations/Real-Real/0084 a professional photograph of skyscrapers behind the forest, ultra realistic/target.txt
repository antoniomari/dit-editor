Generate an image of a grassy park scene with a multi-story building digitally added to the background.

**Background:** The background should depict a park-like setting with a paved road running horizontally across the middle third of the image.  The road separates a line of lush green trees and shrubs from a large expanse of short, even grass in the bottom two-thirds of the image. The trees are varied in height and type, suggesting a mature, established landscape. The sky is a light, slightly hazy blue with a few wispy clouds.  The overall lighting suggests a daytime scene.

**Foreground:** In the foreground, a person with dark hair is seated cross-legged on a tree stump in the bottom right third of the image. They are facing away from the viewer and toward the background, appearing contemplative. The person is wearing a maroon, short-sleeved t-shirt and dark pants. The tree stump is relatively small and natural-looking.

**Foreground Element Interaction with Background:** A large, multi-story building, predominantly dark gray with light-colored accents (possibly white or beige), is digitally imposed into the background behind the line of trees. The building is somewhat tall and has a slightly irregular, almost stepped design to its silhouette. It should be positioned centrally in the background, rising above the treetops and appearing to stand slightly behind them.  The building doesn't interact physically with the background; rather it's digitally superimposed and appears as an element slightly removed from the depth of field of the park. The addition of the building significantly changes the overall scene, transforming the tranquil park into a more urban environment. The scale of the building should be large, and it should be in sharp focus despite the slight haziness of the sky.

**Overall Mood:** The final image should convey a sense of juxtapositionâ€”the calmness of the park contrasted with the stark presence of the urban building in the distance. The person sitting contemplatively adds to this feeling of quiet observation and contemplation. The image should have a photorealistic quality.
