Generate an image of a tranquil waterfront scene at either sunrise or sunset.  The main focus is a long, low-slung bridge spanning a calm body of water. The bridge should have a modern, somewhat industrial design, with distinct supports and a wide roadway.  Behind the bridge, a city skyline is visible, featuring several buildings of varying heights, one prominent high-rise building being clearly visible near the right edge of the frame.  The style should evoke a sense of serene beauty, with a slightly muted, almost vintage color palette.

The lighting should be soft and diffused, characteristic of the golden hour. The sky should be a blend of pastel colors, with muted pinks, oranges, and blues, and a mixture of clouds, some fluffy and others darker, adding depth and interest to the sky. The water should be relatively still, reflecting the sky and the bridge subtly,  creating a mirror-like effect, especially in the foreground.

The foreground should consist of a sandy beach, which stretches from the bottom edge of the image towards the water. The sand is slightly out of focus, to draw attention to the bridge and the skyline. The texture of the sand should be visible, a mix of fine grains and possibly small pebbles.  The overall composition should be a long shot, emphasizing the expansive nature of the scene, with the bridge as the central element,  and the city and sky forming a captivating backdrop. The overall mood should be calm, peaceful, and slightly melancholic, typical of a twilight scene. The image should have a slightly cinematic and realistic look, without being overly saturated or sharp, with a focus on smooth gradients and natural-looking textures.
