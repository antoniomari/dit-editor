Generate a photorealistic image of a suburban backyard scene on a slightly overcast day.  The overall style should be natural and slightly muted, avoiding overly saturated colors.

The scene: The main focus is a large, lush green lawn occupying the majority of the frame.  In the middle ground, a single-story ranch-style house is visible, light brown or beige in color with a dark brown roof.  The house appears relatively simple and unassuming.  Between the viewer and the house is a chain-link fence.  Behind the house, more mature deciduous trees are partially visible.  In the foreground, a strip of light brown, sandy or dry soil runs across the bottom of the image. Sparse, small green plants are scattered sparsely on this area. To the left, a portion of a taller wooden fence is seen.  To the right, some bushes are visible near the back fence.  A powerline runs across the middle ground, near the top of the frame.


Lighting: The lighting should be soft and diffused, indicative of an overcast sky.  There are no harsh shadows; everything is evenly lit. The light should be cool and slightly muted, not bright and sunny.

Composition: The image should be taken from a slightly low angle, looking towards the house and lawn. The foreground of dry soil leads the viewer's eye to the lush green lawn and the house beyond. The trees should frame the scene but not obscure the main elements.  The overall feel should be quiet and peaceful.
