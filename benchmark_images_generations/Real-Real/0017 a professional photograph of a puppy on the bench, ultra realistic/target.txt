Generate an image of a weathered, light grey wooden park bench sitting on a cobblestone path.  The bench is positioned slightly off-center, angled slightly to the left. The path extends from the bottom of the image towards the viewer.  Behind the bench, the background shows a lush green lawn and a wall covered with ivy. The wall has a grid-like pattern subtly visible beneath the ivy.  In the center of the bench, sits a golden retriever puppy. The puppy is facing the viewer, positioned slightly off-center, and appears relaxed. It is light cream/tan in color and  occupies a significant portion of the bench's central seating area. The lighting suggests late afternoon or early evening sun, with soft shadows. The overall style should be realistic and slightly muted in color.  The scene should evoke a peaceful and serene atmosphere.  The focus should be sharpest on the puppy and the bench. The background elements should be slightly softer in focus to draw the viewer's eye to the puppy.
