Generate an image of a large, serene white marble Buddha statue positioned centrally in the foreground.  The statue should be life-sized or larger, appearing imposing yet peaceful.  The Buddha is depicted in a standing position, holding a small alms bowl in one hand, robes draped gracefully.  The statue's facial expression should be calm and contemplative.

The statue is placed atop a low, circular stone base made of various sized, rough-hewn rocks.  This base is simple, appearing rustic and slightly weathered, as though it's been constructed in place.  The Buddha statue should slightly overshadow the stone base, dominating the composition.

The background is a wide, arid desert landscape under a clear, pale blue sky.  The desert is characterized by low-lying brown and tan hills and sparse vegetationâ€”dry shrubs and scrub brush.  A suggestion of a dirt road or path can be seen in the lower right, leading toward some small, distant buildings which appear as simple structures, possibly houses or sheds. The sky should be a clear, light blue with minimal clouds. The overall lighting should be bright, suggestive of daytime sun.

The background landscape should contrast the serenity and whiteness of the Buddha statue.  The statue should be seamlessly integrated into the scene, as though it has been placed deliberately in the middle of the empty space. The lighting on the Buddha should be consistent with the desert lighting, avoiding harsh shadows. The image should evoke a feeling of quiet contemplation and the juxtaposition of the spiritual with the harsh reality of the desert environment.
