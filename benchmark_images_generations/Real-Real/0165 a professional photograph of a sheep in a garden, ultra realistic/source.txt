Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene, viewed from a low perspective,  as if looking across a somewhat sparsely vegetated yard.

**Scene:** The main focus is a large, vibrant green lawn stretching from the foreground to a mid-ground where a ranch-style house sits.  The house is a light brownish-gray, single story, with a simple rectangular shape and visible windows. Behind the house, there are mature deciduous trees of varying heights and shades of green. Part of a wooden fence is visible, bordering the backyard.  A smaller structure, perhaps a shed or storage unit, that looks to be partially screened/covered, is visible between the viewer and the main house.

**Lighting:** The lighting should be soft, diffused daylight, indicative of an overcast day or soft morning/late afternoon light. There should be minimal harsh shadows. The overall ambiance should be calm and peaceful.

**Style:** The style should be photorealistic, with a slightly muted color palette. The image should have a natural, un-staged feel, like an everyday candid shot. The image should have a slightly grainy, slightly washed-out quality, suggestive of a photo taken on a slightly older camera, or possibly in slightly dull lighting conditions.


**Composition:**  The composition should emphasize the expanse of the lawn, leading the viewer's eye towards the house in the midground.  The trees provide a backdrop of depth and framing. The foreground should include a strip of drier, lighter-colored ground, perhaps sandy or compacted dirt, that separates the lawn from the viewing point, suggesting a slight incline in the ground or a pathway.  The overall perspective should be relatively wide, capturing the breadth of the backyard.

Include power lines running horizontally across the background, near the top third of the frame.  A sense of slight disrepair, or a lack of manicured landscaping, should be subtly suggested in the uneven texture of the foreground, and somewhat patchy appearance of the lawn in places.  This should not be overly emphasized, but should hint at the overall feel of the scene.
