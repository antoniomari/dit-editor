Generate an image of a white plate containing a arrangement of fresh strawberries surrounding a chocolate cupcake with light brown frosting. The frosting is swirled and decorated with dark chocolate shavings.  The cupcake is positioned slightly off-center, leaning slightly towards the bottom right.

The strawberries are arranged somewhat haphazardly but generally forming a ring around the cupcake. Some strawberries are whole, some are halved, and they vary slightly in size and ripeness.  Their color ranges from a deep, almost crimson red to slightly lighter shades. The strawberries are glossy and appear juicy.  The strawberries are at a slightly lower height than the cupcake.


The cupcake itself sits atop what appears to be a partially visible, light-colored rectangular cake or dessert, only the top edge of which is visible below the cupcake. This suggests that the cupcake is positioned on a larger dessert base. The lighting is soft and even, avoiding harsh shadows on the food.  The overall style should be reminiscent of a food photograph, with a focus on the vibrant colors and textures of the food.  The background should be softly blurred and out of focus, drawing the eye to the plate of food in the foreground.
