Generate an image of a plate of spring rolls with a small white ramekin of dipping sauce and a garnish of shredded lettuce and shredded carrots.  The spring rolls are golden brown and crispy-looking, arranged somewhat haphazardly on the plate. The sauce in the ramekin is dark amber. The lettuce and carrots are fresh and vibrant in color, situated at the top left of the plate.


Overlaid on the spring rolls and partially obscuring some of them is a rectangular food item. This item is off-white to pale yellow in color and appears to be a burrito or similar type of wrapped food. It is coated with a golden yellow sauce that has flecks of green herbs visible.  The sauce is glossy and shows highlights of light. The texture should look smooth but slightly uneven due to the sauce. This overlaid food item rests mostly in the lower center and slightly towards the right of the plate, overlapping several of the spring rolls below. The placement should suggest it has just been added to the plate.


The overall lighting of the scene should be bright and inviting, emphasizing the golden tones of the spring rolls and the vibrant colors of the garnish and the sauce on the overlaid food item. The style should be photorealistic, with attention to detail in the textures of the food.  The contrast between the crispness of the spring rolls and the softer texture of the overlaid food should be apparent. The background should be blurred subtly, suggesting a shallow depth of field, focusing attention on the food items on the plate.
