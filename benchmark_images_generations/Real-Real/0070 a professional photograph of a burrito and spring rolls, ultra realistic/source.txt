Generate an image of a close-up shot of several golden-brown spring rolls arranged artfully on a clean white plate.  The spring rolls should be slightly overlapping, showcasing their crispy texture and irregular shapes.  A small white ramekin filled with a dark reddish-brown dipping sauce sits amongst them. Beside the ramekin, a small pile of shredded carrots and fresh green lettuce provides a vibrant contrast in color and texture.

The lighting should be soft and natural, diffused and not harsh, creating gentle shadows that highlight the textures of the food and the glossiness of the spring roll skins. The overall style should be realistic, with a focus on detailed textures and accurate color representation. The scene should have a shallow depth of field, with the spring rolls in sharp focus and the background softly blurred. The composition should be balanced, with the spring rolls forming the central focus, and the sauce and garnish complementing the main subject without distracting from it. The overall mood should be inviting and appetizing, suggesting freshness and deliciousness.  The plate is slightly oval or rounded.  The background is out of focus and a muted light wood color is suggested.
