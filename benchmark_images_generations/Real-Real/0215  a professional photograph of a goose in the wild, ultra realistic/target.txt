Generate an image of a serene landscape featuring a grassy, gently sloping hillside. The hillside is covered in a mix of short and tall grasses, interspersed with wildflowers in shades of yellow and other muted tones.  The vegetation is predominantly green, with subtle variations in hue suggesting different types of grasses and flowering plants.  A faint, light brown dirt path winds its way up the hill, almost disappearing into the distance, where the vegetation becomes denser.  In the background, a line of trees forms a dark green backdrop to the scene. These trees are varied in height and density, giving a natural, somewhat uneven horizon line. The overall lighting suggests a sunny day, with the light falling evenly across the scene.

In the foreground, a single, large, white swan rests peacefully on the dirt path near the bottom-center of the image. The swan is positioned so that it partially obscures the path, its feathers appearing soft and smooth. The swan is facing left.  The swan's presence adds a focal point to the image, creating a contrast between the wild landscape and the domestic elegance of the bird.  The swan should blend seamlessly with the environment, not appearing digitally superimposed, but rather as a natural part of the scene. The addition of the swan enhances the overall feeling of tranquility and peacefulness.
