Generate a photorealistic image of a beige teddy bear positioned in the foreground, slightly off-center to the left.  The bear should be looking towards the camera with a friendly expression. Its fur should be soft and slightly fluffy, showing texture.  The bear's nose should be a dark brown, and its eyes should be simple and dark.

The background should depict a rural, sunny landscape. A two-lane asphalt road stretches into the distance, receding towards a horizon filled with gently rolling hills under a bright, clear blue sky.  A few fluffy white clouds are scattered across the sky, adding depth.  The road is flanked by grassy verges.  To the left of the road, a field of tall, dry corn stalks is visible.  In the far background, you should see some low, rounded hills and some industrial-looking structures (possibly silos) near the horizon line to indicate a farming area. The lighting should be bright and natural, indicative of a sunny day. The overall color palette should be warm and inviting, with golden hues in the grasses and corn field.  The style should be photorealistic, almost like a travel photograph taken on a sunny day, with a shallow depth of field so that the bear is in sharp focus but the background is slightly blurred to enhance the foreground subject. The composition should emphasize the contrast between the soft texture of the bear and the vastness of the open road and landscape.  The overall feeling should be calm, peaceful and slightly whimsical due to the presence of the teddy bear.
