Generate an image of a close-up shot of a plate of golden-brown spring rolls arranged artfully on a bright white plate.  The spring rolls should have a slightly crisp texture and show some subtle variations in color, indicating they've been freshly fried.  They are slightly overlapping, creating a dynamic composition.

In the upper left corner, there's a small garnish of shredded carrots and fresh green lettuce, providing a vibrant contrast to the warm tones of the spring rolls.  A small, white ramekin filled with a dark reddish-brown dipping sauce sits near the center, between the spring rolls and the garnish.  The sauce should have a glossy sheen.

The lighting should be soft and diffused, minimizing harsh shadows and highlighting the texture of the spring rolls and the freshness of the garnish. The overall style should be clean, bright, and appetizing, evoking a feeling of casual elegance. The focus should be sharp on the spring rolls, with a slightly shallower depth of field softly blurring the background, which is a simple, out-of-focus light wood table.  The plate should be an elliptical shape, and the overall composition should be centered, with the spring rolls being the focal point. The image should have a slightly warm color temperature, enhancing the golden hues of the spring rolls.
