Generate an image of a fluffy, light beige teddy bear positioned in the foreground, slightly off-center to the left. The bear should be looking towards the viewer with a friendly expression. Its fur should be realistically textured, showing individual strands and slight shading to emphasize its softness.  The bear's nose and eyes are dark brown, simple but expressive.

The background should depict a sunny, rural landscape.  A long, straight, two-lane asphalt road stretches from the bottom-middle to the horizon, vanishing point roughly in the middle of the frame.  On either side of the road, there's a strip of neatly kept grass. To the left of the road, there is a field of tall, dry, golden-brown corn stalks. Beyond the cornfield, there is lush green grass and then a distant range of low, rolling hills under a mostly clear, bright blue sky.  A few fluffy cumulus clouds are scattered across the sky.   The lighting should be bright and natural, with the sun seeming to be high in the sky casting soft shadows. In the distance,  some industrial structures – possibly silos or farm buildings – are faintly visible beyond the cornfield on the right-hand side of the road.

The overall style should be photorealistic, aiming for a slightly whimsical feel due to the contrast between the cute teddy bear and the vast, open landscape. The color palette should be warm and inviting, with vibrant greens, golden browns, and the bright blue of the sky. The composition should lead the viewer's eye down the road towards the horizon, using the bear in the foreground as a focal point and guide to the scene. The depth of field should be relatively shallow, with the bear clearly in focus and the background slightly softer, creating a sense of distance and perspective.
