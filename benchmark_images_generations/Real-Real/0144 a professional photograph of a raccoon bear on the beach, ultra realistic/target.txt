Generate an image depicting a tranquil waterfront scene at sunset.  The background should feature a long, modern bridge spanning a wide body of water.  The bridge should be silhouetted against a twilight sky filled with dramatic, slightly muted, pastel-toned clouds (think pinks, oranges, and blues blending seamlessly).  Behind the bridge, a city skyline is visible, dominated by a tall, rectangular building – a hotel or office building – with several smaller buildings flanking it. The water should be calm, reflecting the colors of the sky and the bridge.  The shoreline should be a sandy beach, textured and slightly coarse, appearing dark in the lower light.


In the foreground, place a single, fluffy raccoon. The raccoon should be positioned near the center of the image, sitting on the sandy beach, facing the viewer. Its fur should be detailed, showing individual hairs, and its expression should be one of peaceful foraging. The raccoon should be slightly lower than the bridge's horizontal line within the image.  The raccoon appears to be looking down, possibly foraging, and does not appear to be disturbed by the setting. The overall lighting should maintain the sunset's soft glow while also clearly defining the raccoon. The raccoon should be realistically rendered, fitting naturally into the scene and not appearing pasted or out of place.


The entire scene should have a calm, almost melancholic, atmosphere, enhanced by the soft colors of the sky and the peaceful demeanor of the raccoon.  The foreground beach area is darker than the background, creating contrast. The placement of the raccoon helps draw the viewer's eye to it first, establishing it as the main focus despite the significant background. The addition of the raccoon does not change the overall atmosphere of the scene, but instead adds a point of interest and a feeling of quiet life existing within the urban landscape.
