Generate a landscape image in a photorealistic style.  The scene is a gently sloping hillside, dominated by a grassy path that meanders from the foreground towards a copse of trees in the midground.

**Scene:** The path is light green to tan in color, appearing well-trodden but not paved. It cuts through a field of tall grasses and wildflowers, primarily in shades of light green and yellow.  Patches of taller, darker green vegetation are interspersed, suggesting a variety of plants. The lower portion of the foreground is relatively close to the viewer, and is densely packed with wildflower blooms, predominantly yellow.   In the mid-ground, a small grove of deciduous trees with reddish-brown leaves stands out against the background. These trees are somewhat irregular in shape and height, giving a natural, untamed appearance. The background consists of a rolling hillside covered with dense, dark green evergreen trees, suggesting a forest. The overall impression is one of a rural, perhaps mountainous, area.

**Lighting:** The scene is bathed in soft, diffused sunlight. There are no harsh shadows. The light is evenly distributed across the scene, creating a bright, airy atmosphere. The overall color palette is muted and natural, with soft greens, yellows, and browns dominating. A slight hazy effect should be applied to create a sense of distance and depth.

**Style:** The style should be photorealistic, capturing the minute details of the plants, grass, and textures of the ground. The image should appear natural and untouched. The focus should be sharp in the foreground and mid-ground, gradually softening towards the background to create depth of field.  The overall mood should be tranquil and peaceful.

**Composition:** The path serves as a leading line, drawing the viewer's eye into the scene and toward the small copse of trees.  The composition should be balanced, with the foreground wildflowers providing visual interest while the background forest provides context. The rule of thirds can be subtly applied, with the path and tree copse positioned slightly off-center. The image should have a relatively wide field of view, capturing the breadth of the hillside and the expansive feeling of the landscape.
