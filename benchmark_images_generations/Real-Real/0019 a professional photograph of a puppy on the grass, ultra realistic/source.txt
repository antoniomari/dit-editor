Generate an image of a grey rabbit sitting in dappled sunlight under the shade of a coniferous tree.


**Scene:** A grey rabbit, predominantly dark grey with lighter grey undertones, is seated on short, slightly unkempt grass.  The grass is a muted green, with a few small, white wildflowers sparsely scattered across it. The rabbit is positioned slightly off-center, facing to the right of the frame. A large, dark-brown tree trunk is visible to the rabbit's left, partially obscuring the view.

**Lighting:** The scene is bathed in soft, natural daylight. The light appears to be diffused, creating subtle shadows and highlights on the rabbit's fur and the surrounding grass. The area directly under the tree is slightly shaded, while the area beyond receives more direct sunlight.  There's a gentle contrast between the shaded areas and the sunlit parts of the grass.

**Style:**  The overall style should be photorealistic, with a slightly muted color palette. The image should have a calm, peaceful atmosphere.  The focus should be sharp on the rabbit, with a gradual decrease in sharpness towards the background. The detail level should be moderate to high, capturing the texture of the rabbit's fur, the blades of grass, and the bark of the tree.

**Composition:**  The composition should be simple and natural. The tree branches form a natural canopy above the rabbit, providing a frame for the scene.  The rabbit is the clear focal point, positioned to allow for a comfortable viewing distance.  The depth of field should be relatively shallow, further emphasizing the rabbit. The background is a softly blurred expanse of grass, extending to the horizon. The perspective is from a slightly elevated angle, looking down at the rabbit.

The overall feeling should be one of quiet observation of a wild creature in its natural habitat.  The image should be devoid of any human elements.
