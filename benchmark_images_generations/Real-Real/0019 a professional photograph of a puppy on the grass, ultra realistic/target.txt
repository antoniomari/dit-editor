Generate an image depicting a grassy area partially shaded by a coniferous tree.  The grass is short and a light brownish-green.  Scattered small white flowers are present on the grass.

The background should feature the aforementioned grass and tree. The tree trunk is visible on the left, dark brown and textured. The branches extend across a significant portion of the upper half of the image, casting shade on the grass below.

In the foreground, positioned slightly to the right and closer to the viewer than the rabbit, is a fluffy white Maltese dog.  The dog is standing on all fours, with its body facing slightly to the left, as if observing the rabbit.  The dog's fur appears thick and somewhat unruly. It is placed in the lower-middle right of the scene, about one-third of the way up from the bottom of the frame.  It should be clearly distinct from the background.

To the left and somewhat behind the dog, a small, grey-brown rabbit is positioned closer to the tree's shade. The rabbit is sitting, facing slightly towards the right, appearing alert and observing its surroundings. It is placed in the lower-middle left of the scene. The rabbit should also be clearly distinct from the background.

The overall scene should appear peaceful, with the dog and rabbit seemingly coexisting without direct interaction but within close enough proximity to suggest awareness of each other. The lighting should be soft and natural, indicative of daylight under some tree cover.  The overall color palette should be muted greens and browns, with the stark white of the dog providing contrast.  The focus should be sharp on both the dog and the rabbit.
