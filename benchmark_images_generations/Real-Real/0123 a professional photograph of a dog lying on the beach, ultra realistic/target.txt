Generate an image of a beach scene at sunset. The background should feature a long, modern bridge spanning a wide body of water.  In the background, to the right of the bridge, a city skyline is visible. This skyline includes several buildings, one prominent tall rectangular building standing out among the others.  The sky should be a dramatic blend of sunset colors, with oranges, pinks, and purples mixing with darker blues and clouds. The water should reflect the sky and city lights subtly. The beach in the foreground should be composed of dark, coarse sand or small pebbles.

The foreground element is a young, tri-colored Australian Shepherd puppy. The puppy is positioned in the lower-center to lower-third of the image, lying on its belly on the beach, facing the viewer, with its head slightly tilted to its right.  The puppy should have a primarily black and white coat, with some tan markings on its head and legs.  It should have a blue collar. The puppy's fur should appear soft and fluffy. The puppy should not be obscuring any part of the background; instead, it should be seamlessly integrated into the beach scene, appearing as though it is actually present on the beach.  The overall lighting should be soft and complementary to the sunset, with the puppy well-lit but not harshly so.  The image should maintain a natural, calm, and inviting atmosphere.
