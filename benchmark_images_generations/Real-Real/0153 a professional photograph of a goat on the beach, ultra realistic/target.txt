Generate an image of a rocky, sandy beach at sunset. The beach is in the foreground, and stretches from the bottom of the frame to about 1/3 of the way up.  The beach is composed of small, dark-grey and brown pebbles and stones.

In the midground, a body of calm water occupies a horizontal band.  The water appears dark, reflecting the colors of the sky.

In the background, a long bridge spans the water, with a city skyline visible beyond it. The bridge is gray and has multiple spans. The skyline features several mid-rise buildings, one of which is a prominent high-rise building; these are rendered in dark muted colors. The sky is a mix of sunset hues (orange, pink, purple) with cloudy areas that are dark blue and grey.

The main foreground element is a young, light-brown ibex or similar mountain goat. This goat is positioned on the beach, slightly to the left of center, facing towards the viewer.  The goat appears to stand calmly and is positioned slightly angled away from the camera. Its fur is textured and appears somewhat shaggy. The overall lighting on the goat blends reasonably well with the sunset lighting of the overall scene. The goat's size is relatively large compared to the pebbles on the beach, giving it a presence in the scene.  There is no artificial shadow added below the goat. The composition creates a juxtaposition between the wild animal and the urban landscape. The goat should not appear pasted onto the image; rather, the integration should be seamless, as if it naturally belongs in this improbable location.
