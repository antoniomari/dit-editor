Generate an image of a beach scene at sunset or sunrise.  The background should feature a long, multi-span bridge extending across a body of water.  On the far shore, there are several buildings, including a prominent, multi-story rectangular building that looks like a hotel or office building.  The sky should be a dramatic mix of clouds, with warm colors near the horizon and cooler tones higher up. The water should be relatively calm, reflecting the sky and bridge.

In the foreground, place a small, fluffy white dog, a breed resembling a Bichon Frise or similar, positioned slightly off-center.  The dog should appear to be standing on a sandy or gravelly beach, facing slightly away from the camera, with its head slightly down.  It should be wearing a light-blue harness or collar. The dog is not interacting directly with the bridge or buildings but is situated in a way that it draws the eye to the background scene, creating a calm, tranquil atmosphere.

The lighting should be consistent with the sunset/sunrise, casting soft shadows and highlighting the textures of the sand, the dog's fur, and the clouds in the sky.  The overall scene should feel peaceful and serene, with the dog serving as a focal point in the foreground that contrasts with the scale and grandeur of the background. The focus should be fairly even across the foreground and background, with neither being excessively blurred.
