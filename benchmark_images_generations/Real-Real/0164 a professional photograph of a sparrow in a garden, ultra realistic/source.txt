Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene on a slightly overcast day.

**Scene:** The main focus is a large, verdant lawn stretching from the foreground to a mid-ground where a single-story house sits.  The house is light brown or beige, with a simple, slightly gabled roof.  It appears to have several windows, and a partially visible porch or patio area.  The lawn is a bright, even green with some subtle variations in shade suggesting slight undulation.  Behind the house are more mature trees, similar to those in the foreground. There is a chain-link fence running along the left edge of the yard, and a hint of another structure (possibly a shed) partially obscured by trees and the fence, to the left of the house.  Some sparse landscaping is visible near the house. The foreground consists of a slightly patchy area of sandy or light-colored soil, indicating either a dry patch of the yard or a pathway.

**Lighting:** The lighting should be soft and diffused, suggesting an overcast sky.  There are no harsh shadows.  The overall light is even, with subtle variations in brightness across the lawn.


**Style:**  The style should be photorealistic, with a slightly muted color palette. The image should look like a natural, candid shot, not overly stylized or dramatic.


**Composition:** The composition should be a fairly wide shot, encompassing the entire lawn and the house in the background.  The perspective should be from a slightly low angle, looking across the yard toward the house.  The rule of thirds could be subtly applied, placing the house off-center. The foreground’s sandy patch adds some visual interest and balances the largely green composition. The trees provide depth and frame the house.


**Additional details:**

* The trees are deciduous and lush with green leaves, suggesting springtime or early summer.
* The overall mood is calm and peaceful, suggesting a quiet suburban neighborhood.
* The level of detail should be moderate—enough to show the texture of the grass and the details of the house, but not excessively detailed.  


The image should feel naturalistic and everyday.
