Generate an image of a grey rabbit sitting in dappled sunlight under the shade of a coniferous tree.

**Scene:** The rabbit is positioned slightly off-center, facing right, in a grassy area. The grass is short and somewhat patchy, with a few small white flowers scattered sparsely across the ground.  A large tree trunk, part of a coniferous tree (possibly a fir or spruce), stands to the left of the rabbit, casting a partial shadow.  The background is a slightly out-of-focus grassy area, suggesting a park-like setting. The overall environment should feel peaceful and natural.

**Lighting:** The lighting should be soft and natural, suggesting a sunny day with some cloud cover. The sunlight should be dappled through the branches of the tree, creating areas of light and shadow on the ground and the rabbit.  The rabbit should be relatively well-lit, but not harshly so.

**Style:** The style should be photorealistic, aiming for a high level of detail in the fur of the rabbit and the texture of the grass and tree bark. The overall feel should be naturalistic and slightly muted in color tones, avoiding overly saturated or vibrant colors.  The depth of field should be shallow, with the rabbit in sharp focus and the background slightly blurred.

**Composition:** The composition should be relatively simple and uncluttered, focusing attention on the rabbit. The tree branches provide a natural frame for the rabbit and help lead the eye to the subject.  The overall mood should be calm and serene.  The image should have a slightly warm color temperature.
