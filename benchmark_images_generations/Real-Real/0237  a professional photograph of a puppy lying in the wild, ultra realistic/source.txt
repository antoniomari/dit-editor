Generate a background image depicting a gently sloping hillside meadow bathed in soft, diffused sunlight.  The scene should have a dreamy, slightly hazy quality, with a subtle, soft focus effect, especially in the mid-ground and background.


**Scene:**

* The foreground consists of a wildflower meadow with various shades of green grasses and low-lying yellow wildflowers.  Include some taller, slender plants with reddish-brown blooms. The wildflowers should be scattered naturally, not in perfectly ordered rows.
* A light dirt path winds gently upward from the bottom-center towards the midground. The path should be subtly worn and uneven, not perfectly smooth.
*  In the mid-ground, the path passes through a small grove of leafy, deciduous trees (mainly light reddish-brown and green foliage) which add depth and create a break in the grassy expanse.
* The background is comprised of a dense, rolling hillside covered with evergreen trees, mostly dark green with hints of lighter green amongst them,  creating a lush, natural feel.  The trees in the background should be slightly less defined than those in the mid-ground, adding to the atmospheric perspective.  The hillside should gently undulate, suggesting a natural landscape.  Slight variations in the shades of green are desirable.

**Lighting:**

* The lighting should be bright but diffused, suggesting an overcast day or soft sunlight filtering through light clouds.  Avoid harsh shadows; instead, aim for even illumination across the scene with a slightly brighter area in the mid-ground where the path and trees are.

**Style:**

* The overall style should be photorealistic, but with a touch of soft, dreamy quality – the edges of everything should not be harsh; this includes the plants and edges of the path. The image needs to be very peaceful and serene.
* The colors should be natural and muted, predominantly greens, yellows, and browns, with a consistent color palette across the scene.  Slightly desaturated colors will enhance the soft, dreamy effect.


**Composition:**

* The composition should guide the viewer's eye along the path, creating a sense of depth and leading them up the hillside.
* The rule of thirds should be subtly followed, with the path and trees not being exactly in the center.
* Ensure a harmonious balance between the different elements – wildflowers, path, trees, and sky (only slightly visible behind the trees)-, creating a visually pleasing and serene composition.  The emphasis should be on the gentle curve of the path leading the eye into the background.


The final image should evoke a sense of tranquility and peaceful natural beauty.  The overall feel should be gentle, calming and peaceful.
