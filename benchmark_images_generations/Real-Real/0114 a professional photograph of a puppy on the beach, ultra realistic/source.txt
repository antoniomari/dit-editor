Generate an image of a tranquil waterfront scene at either sunrise or sunset.  The style should be realistic, aiming for a slightly muted and slightly desaturated color palette. Think of a slightly faded photograph, with natural, soft light.


**Scene:**

* The central focus is a long, relatively low-lying bridge spanning a calm body of water. The bridge should be a dark grey or silhouetted against the sky. It has several arches or spans visible.
* In the background, a mid-rise building, possibly a hotel or office building, stands tall. It's a rectangular structure, dark in color, and relatively simple in design.  To the right and slightly behind,  a smaller, less prominent building is also visible.
* The foreground is a sandy beach or shoreline, extending from the bottom of the frame to roughly one-third of the way up. The sand should appear slightly coarse and textured, with small pebbles or shells subtly visible.
* The water is relatively calm, showing a slight reflection of the sky and the bridge.  There's a subtle motion blur effect to the water, suggesting a gentle current.


**Lighting:**

* The lighting is soft and diffused, indicative of either early morning sunrise or late evening sunset. The light should be warmer in the sky, with a gradient from warmer oranges and yellows at the horizon to cooler blues and purples higher up. There should be some soft clouds, mostly cumulus or stratus types.  The overall feeling is calm and serene.
* The bridge and buildings should be largely in shadow, contrasting against the brighter sky.  There should be no harsh shadows.


**Composition:**

* The image should be composed in a way that places the bridge as the main horizontal element, creating a sense of depth.  The foreground sand provides a leading line drawing the eye to the bridge and the buildings beyond.
* The rule of thirds should be loosely applied.  The bridge is placed roughly in the middle-ground, with the sky and the water/sand equally dividing the rest of the frame.
* The overall aspect ratio should be roughly landscape oriented.


**Style:**

* Photorealistic style with a slightly desaturated or muted color palette. The colors shouldn't be overly vibrant or saturated, aiming for a more natural and subdued look, as if a vintage photograph that retains a sense of realism.
* A slight film grain or texture to the image would enhance the slightly faded or vintage feel. The overall impression should be one of tranquility and serenity.
