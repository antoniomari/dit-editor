Generate an image of a close-up shot of a plate of golden-brown spring rolls, arranged somewhat haphazardly.  The spring rolls should have a slightly crispy texture suggested by subtle highlights and shadows.  They are arranged on a clean, bright white plate.

In the upper left corner of the plate, there's a small garnish of shredded carrots and fresh green lettuce. To the upper-center, a small, simple white ramekin holds a dark reddish-brown dipping sauce; the sauce should appear slightly glossy.  The lighting is soft and diffused, preventing harsh shadows and creating a warm, inviting mood. The overall style is clean, realistic, and appetizing, focusing on the texture and color of the food. The composition is slightly asymmetrical, with the spring rolls clustered toward the bottom and center of the frame. The background should be subtly blurred, perhaps a light wood table, barely visible. The depth of field should be shallow, focusing primarily on the spring rolls and sauce. The overall color palette is warm and inviting, with the golden browns of the spring rolls contrasting nicely with the greens of the lettuce and the reddish brown of the sauce.
