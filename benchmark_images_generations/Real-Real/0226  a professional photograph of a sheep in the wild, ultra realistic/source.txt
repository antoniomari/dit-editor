Generate an image of a gently sloping hillside scene bathed in soft, diffused sunlight. The style should be photorealistic, aiming for a slightly hazy, dreamlike quality.  The overall color palette should be predominantly various shades of green, with touches of yellow wildflowers and hints of reddish-brown in the distant foliage.


The scene:  A grassy path, slightly worn and pale, meanders from the lower foreground to the middle ground, disappearing gently into a field of tall grasses and wildflowers.  On either side of the path are uneven banks, the left steeper than the right, both covered with a mixture of wildflowers â€“ mostly small yellow blossoms interspersed with taller, finer textured green plants.

In the middle ground, a small copse of trees, primarily various shades of light green and reddish-brown, adds a visual break in the monotony of the grassy expanse. These trees are slightly blurred to emphasize the depth of field. Beyond this copse of trees the grassy path seems to continue, disappearing into the distance.

The background features a dense hillside covered with evergreen trees that are dark green but slightly desaturated, adding to the overall dreamlike feel. The trees are densely packed, suggesting a forested area but not overly detailed; maintain a soft focus in the background.

Lighting: The lighting should be soft, diffused sunlight, typical of a hazy summer day.  Avoid harsh shadows; the light should gently illuminate the entire scene, without significant contrast or harsh highlights. The light should be warmer, leaning towards the yellow-orange spectrum to convey a feeling of afternoon sun.

Composition:  The path acts as a strong leading line drawing the eye into the image from the bottom to the middle ground. The composition should feel natural and organically flowing, rather than strictly symmetrical or geometric. The wildflowers in the foreground should be clearly visible, while the background gradually softens in detail, enhancing the sense of depth.
