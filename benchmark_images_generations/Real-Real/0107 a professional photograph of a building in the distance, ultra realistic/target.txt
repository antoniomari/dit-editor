Generate an image of a rocky, mountainous landscape under a clear blue sky.  The background should depict a dry, somewhat barren scene with low-lying vegetation and rocky cliffs, similar to a high-altitude plateau. A range of hills is visible in the mid-ground.

In the background, slightly off-center, levitate a large, modern, white high-rise building with unusual, almost organic-looking architectural features.  The building appears somewhat distorted, as if viewed through a slight lens effect, adding to its surreal quality. Think of a very stylized, almost impossible architecture. The building should have large windows and slightly irregular horizontal lines. There's a glimpse of what looks like a billboard or advertisement on one of the building's sides.

In the foreground, positioned towards the lower right third of the image, place a medium-sized, plush brown teddy bear. The bear is sitting upright, looking somewhat towards the levitating building. It should appear slightly worn or well-loved.  The bear is sitting amongst a collection of irregularly shaped grey and brown rocks and stones. The rocks are rough-textured and of varying sizes. The overall feel should convey a sense of scale, with the immense building and the tiny bear nestled amongst the stones.

The overall lighting should be consistent with a sunny day. The colors should be natural and slightly muted, emphasizing the contrast between the brown teddy bear, the stark white building, and the earthy tones of the landscape. The surreal juxtaposition of the teddy bear, the modern building, and the ancient-looking rocky landscape is key to the scene's impact.  The teddy bear should not be heavily shadowed, indicating bright, diffused lighting. The composition should strongly emphasize the sense of scale disparity and unexpected placement of the elements.
