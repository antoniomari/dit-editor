Generate an image of a Coney Island hot dog positioned centrally on a white plate.  The hot dog should be prominently featured, taking up a significant portion of the foreground.  It should have a toasted bun, a generous serving of chili (dark brown, slightly glossy), a visible hot dog nestled within, and at least one slice of pale yellow cheese peeking out from under the chili.

The hot dog is placed slightly off-center to allow space for the other elements. Surrounding the hot dog are fresh strawberries, arranged somewhat casually but attractively around the main dish.  The strawberries are a vibrant red, with visible seeds and a slightly glossy texture.  They should be placed in a slightly irregular ring around the hot dog, not in perfect symmetry.

In the background, partially visible behind and slightly under the hot dog, is a piece of cheesecake (light yellow/tan color) â€“ just a section of it is visible.  The cheesecake should be slightly blurred, to indicate depth of field and to emphasize the hot dog as the main focus.  The cheesecake should look creamy and smooth in texture, not grainy.

The entire scene should be set on a clean white plate, which occupies most of the image.  The plate's edges should be visible, and it should appear to be reflecting a bit of light. The background behind the plate should be subtly out-of-focus, a neutral light tan or beige tone.  The overall lighting of the image should be soft and natural, like a well-lit kitchen table setting.  The overall style should be realistic, focusing on the texture and details of each element.
