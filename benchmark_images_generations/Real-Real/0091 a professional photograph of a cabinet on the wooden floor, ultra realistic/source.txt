Generate an image of a cozy, lived-in room with a warm, slightly dim lighting scheme.  The style should be realistic, leaning towards photorealism.

The room is rectangular, with light-colored hardwood floors reflecting the light subtly.  The walls are a light beige or cream color.  Large, sheer, light gold or beige curtains frame a window that takes up a significant portion of one wall, allowing soft, diffused natural light to flood the room.  The curtains have a slight sheen or texture to them.

In the room:

* **Furniture:** A small, plaid upholstered armchair or ottoman sits near the window.  A simple wooden shelf/stand holds a vintage-style television (perhaps a boxy CRT model). The TV stands on a small, light-colored wooden cabinet or stand.  A dark-colored, relatively small, low-to-the-ground sofa or loveseat is partially visible in the lower right corner. A small, dark wooden side table sits next to the sofa.


* **Decor:**  A tall, slightly eclectic bookshelf stands against the wall, filled with books of varying sizes and colors.  The shelf's design incorporates some patterned or textured elements. A framed painting or print is on the wall near the bookshelf, with slightly muted, possibly earth-toned colors.  A wooden easel, slightly worn, stands prominently in the left foreground, partially obscuring a canvas or painting.


* **Musical Instruments:**  An acoustic guitar leans against the bookshelf, visible from the side, adding to the lived-in feel.  Another musical instrument, perhaps a slightly larger guitar, is partly visible behind the main one.


* **Lighting:** The main light source is soft, natural light filtering through the curtains.  A small table lamp with a warm-toned light illuminates the area near the television, casting a subtle glow on the surrounding objects. The overall lighting should be warm and inviting, not harsh or overly bright.  A ceiling light is visible, but not the primary source of light.


* **Overall Composition:** The perspective should be from a slightly elevated viewpoint, looking towards the window and across the room. The floor should be visible and play a significant part of the composition.  The image should have a somewhat intimate and quiet feeling, creating a sense of calm.  Depth of field should create a focus on the middle ground, with the foreground and background slightly less sharp.
