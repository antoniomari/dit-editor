Generate a photorealistic image of a slice of tiramisu cake on a white plate surrounded by fresh strawberries.

**Scene:** The main focus is a single, generous slice of tiramisu cake.  The cake should be layered, showing distinct layers of coffee-soaked ladyfingers and a creamy, light-colored mascarpone filling. The top is glossy, possibly with a light, transparent glaze, and a visible coffee bean resting on top. The cake should appear moist and rich.  Several fresh, bright red strawberries are arranged artfully around the cake on a white, slightly reflective plate. The strawberries should be diverse in size and orientation, some whole, others slightly out of focus to create a sense of depth.

**Lighting:** Soft, diffused light, possibly from a window, illuminates the scene.  Avoid harsh shadows. The light should highlight the glossy finish of the cake and the juicy redness of the strawberries, creating a warm, inviting atmosphere.  Slight reflections on the plate and the glossy cake are desired.

**Style:** Photorealistic, high-resolution image with a focus on detail and texture. The overall style should be clean and elegant, similar to a high-quality food photograph in a magazine or cookbook.  The image should have a shallow depth of field, slightly blurring the background to draw attention to the cake and strawberries.

**Composition:** The cake is centrally located on the plate, with the strawberries arranged in an aesthetically pleasing, somewhat scattered pattern around it. The plate itself is also centered in the frame, leaving some white space around its edges. The overall composition should be balanced and visually appealing, emphasizing the deliciousness of the dessert.  The background should be a simple, out-of-focus, neutral color (a pale off-white or light grey works well) to avoid distractions from the main subject.
