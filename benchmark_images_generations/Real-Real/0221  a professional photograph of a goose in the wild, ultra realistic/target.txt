Generate an image of a gently sloping grassy hillside, abundant with wildflowers and various green shrubs and trees of varying heights. The hillside extends from the foreground to the midground, leading to a dense backdrop of dark green coniferous trees on a higher elevation.  A faint, well-worn dirt path meanders through the center of the grassy hillside, curving slightly to the left in the midground.

The path is relatively clear of vegetation, save for some sparse grass and wildflowers.  In the lower right, positioned on the dirt path, is a single, light grey goose.  The goose is facing to the left, its body slightly tilted, suggesting a resting pose.  The goose is relatively detailed compared to the softer focus of the background. The goose should be realistically rendered with visible feathers and natural lighting.


The overall lighting should be bright and natural, indicative of a sunny day. The colors should be vibrant, reflecting a lush green environment with touches of yellow from the wildflowers.  The perspective should be from a slightly elevated vantage point, offering a view of the landscape extending to the background. The color and contrast should be largely consistent with the original image, ensuring that the added goose appears natural and seamlessly integrated into the scene. No major changes are needed to the background; the goal is simply to add the goose as a realistic element.
