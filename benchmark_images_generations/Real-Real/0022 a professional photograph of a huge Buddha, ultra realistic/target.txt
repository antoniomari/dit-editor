Generate an image of a serene, white marble Buddha statue positioned atop a crumbling, classical-style rotunda.

**Foreground:**

* The Buddha statue is the primary foreground element.  It's a full-body rendering, appearing serene and peaceful, holding what looks like a alms bowl in its lap.  The statue's material should be rendered as smooth, polished white marble with subtle light reflections to highlight its form.  It is centrally positioned atop the rotunda, appearing slightly larger than the structure itself to emphasize its importance.

**Background:**

* The background is a partially ruined rotunda,  a circular classical structure with visible signs of age and decay.  The stone appears weathered, with overgrown vegetation sprouting from cracks and crevices in the walls and roof.  The architecture features arched doorways and windows, some intact and others showing significant damage.  The building seems to be situated in a park-like setting.  Surrounding the rotunda are lush green trees and shrubs, partially obscuring the base of the structure and adding a sense of nature reclaiming the building.  The sky above is a clear, bright blue. A portion of what looks like a brown animal (a camel or similar) is visible in the very bottom right corner, partly obscuring the lower vegetation near the rotunda.

**Interaction:**

* The Buddha statue sits perfectly centered on the top of the rotunda. There's no physical interaction between the statue and the rotunda; it simply rests on the top. The stark contrast between the pristine white of the Buddha and the aged, weathered stone of the rotunda creates a visually striking juxtaposition, symbolizing perhaps the enduring spirit of peace in the face of decay.  The size of the Buddha compared to the rotunda adds to the surreal, almost dreamlike quality of the scene.  The vegetation helps blend the statue into the scene but still maintains the contrast with the architectural element below.

**Overall Scene:**

The overall scene should evoke a feeling of peaceful contemplation, tinged with a sense of history and the passage of time. The incongruity of a pristine Buddha statue atop a crumbling structure creates a visually arresting and thought-provoking composition. The lighting should be soft and diffused, creating a calm and serene atmosphere.
