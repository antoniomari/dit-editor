Generate an image of a grassy hillside scene with a dirt path meandering through it. The hillside is dotted with various green shrubs and trees, creating a slightly uneven terrain.  The path is light brownish-grey, showing some texture and small stones. 


In the foreground, slightly to the left of the center, place a German Shepherd-like dog.  The dog is mid-stride, appearing to be running or playfully bounding along the path. It's a predominantly black and tan dog, with the tan fur concentrated on its face, chest, and legs. The dog should be sharply focused and realistic, appearing as if it is truly moving through the scene. The dog's body is angled slightly towards the right, with its head tilted slightly downwards, giving the impression of forward motion. The dog's tail is slightly raised. It should look energetic and lively.

The dog should be placed in the grassy area next to the path, not directly on it, making it look as if it is running through the tall grass. Some yellow wildflowers should be visible around its legs and in the immediate vicinity.  

The background should maintain its pastoral look; it is mostly a green hill that's slightly sunlit and appears to be somewhat distant, adding depth to the scene. The blending between the foreground and the background should be seamless, so the dog appears naturally integrated into the environment. No visible changes to the background should be apparent besides the addition of the dog. The overall lighting should be natural daylight, with a slight warmth to it.
