Generate an image of a white plate containing a variety of foods.  The main focus is a roasted chicken, realistically rendered with crispy brown skin and visible stuffing (possibly containing carrots and other vegetables), situated centrally on the plate but slightly overlapping with other food items.  The chicken is positioned so its legs are pointing toward the bottom right corner.

Surrounding the chicken are several golden-brown spring rolls, some whole and some partially obscured by the chicken and each other. They appear crispy and slightly oily. The spring rolls are unevenly distributed, some clustered closer to the top left of the plate and others near the bottom right.

In the upper left quadrant of the plate, a small pile of shredded carrots and light green lettuce provides a contrasting color.  A small, white ramekin filled with a dark brown sauce is also placed near the spring rolls and lettuce in the upper left, slightly behind the spring rolls. The sauce appears rich and slightly glossy.

The overall lighting should be soft and bright, highlighting the textures and colors of the food.  The plate itself is clean and white, providing a stark contrast to the warm tones of the food. The background is blurred but suggests a light-colored table. The focus should be sharply on the food, particularly the roasted chicken and the details of its texture and color.  The depth of field should emphasize the food items in the foreground, creating a shallow depth of field and making the background out of focus.
