Generate an image of a close-up shot of a plate of golden-brown spring rolls arranged artfully.  The rolls are slightly uneven in size and shape, suggesting a homemade or authentic feel.  They are glistening slightly, implying they are freshly fried and possibly still warm.  

In the upper left corner, there is a small garnish of shredded carrots and fresh green lettuce.  A small, white ramekin containing a dark reddish-brown dipping sauce sits near the center, partially obscured by the spring rolls. The sauce appears slightly glossy.

The plate itself is simple, white and slightly reflective, with a gently curved shape.  The background is softly blurred, suggesting a light wooden table. The overall lighting is soft and warm, casting a subtle glow on the spring rolls, enhancing their texture and color.  The style should be realistic and appetizing, focusing on the food's texture and visual appeal with a shallow depth of field to emphasize the spring rolls. The composition should be relatively close-up, filling most of the frame with the spring rolls and the small amount of garnish, with the background details blurred and unobtrusive.
