Generate an image of a close-up shot of a plate of golden-brown spring rolls arranged artfully.  The rolls should be crisp-looking and slightly irregular in shape, suggesting homemade authenticity.  There should be a variety of angles and overlaps in their arrangement, creating visual interest.  

The plate is clean, simple, bright white, and oval-shaped.  In the upper-left corner, a small garnish of shredded carrots and fresh green lettuce provides a pop of color and contrast.  A small, simple white ramekin sits near the center, filled with a dark, reddish-brown dipping sauce, likely a sweet and sour or soy-based sauce. The sauce should have a slight sheen to it.

The lighting should be soft and diffused, minimizing harsh shadows.  The overall style should be bright, clean, and appetizing, resembling high-quality food photography. The focus should be sharpest on the spring rolls in the center and slightly softer on the edges and garnish.  The background should be subtly blurred, with a hint of a light wood table visible in the upper right corner.  The overall aesthetic should be inviting and evoke feelings of freshness and deliciousness. The color palette should be predominantly warm tones with accents of green from the lettuce.
