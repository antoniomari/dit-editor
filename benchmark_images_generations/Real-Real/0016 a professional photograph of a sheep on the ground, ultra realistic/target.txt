Generate an image of a weathered, light grey wooden park bench sitting on a patch of short, slightly unkempt grass. The bench is positioned slightly off-center, with its back against a wall covered with a grid-like pattern and climbing ivy. The ivy is a mix of green and yellowish-brown, suggesting late autumn or early spring.  The wall itself seems to be part of a building or fence, with vertical wooden slats visible above the grid section.

The foreground element is a single sheep, a light beige or grayish-white with slightly darker patches, particularly around its flanks.  It appears fluffy and somewhat scruffy. The sheep is positioned partially in front of the bench, sitting as if resting beneath it, but not actually touching the bench. The sheep's body is angled slightly to the right, and it looks directly toward the viewer, creating a sense of interaction. The placement of the sheep adds a surprising and unexpected element to the scene, contrasting the typical park setting with the presence of farm animal. The overall lighting is soft and natural, suggestive of late afternoon or early evening sunlight. The ground in the foreground is a cobblestone pavement that extends from the edge of the grass patch toward the bottom of the frame. The shadows cast by the bench and the sheep should be realistic and in keeping with the implied sunlight.
