Generate an image of a close-up shot of a plate of golden-brown spring rolls arranged artfully on a bright white, slightly reflective plate.  The spring rolls vary slightly in size and shape, suggesting a homemade, rustic quality rather than perfect uniformity.  Some are stacked slightly on top of each other, while others lay individually.

Next to the spring rolls is a small, clean white ramekin filled with a dark reddish-brown dipping sauce. The sauce is smooth and glossy, reflecting a soft light.  Beside the ramekin, there's a small garnish of shredded green lettuce and thin, bright orange carrot strips. The lettuce looks fresh and crisp, providing a vibrant green contrast to the warm tones of the spring rolls and sauce.

The lighting should be soft and diffused, avoiding harsh shadows. The overall style should be photorealistic, with a shallow depth of field slightly blurring the background, drawing attention to the spring rolls, sauce, and garnish in the foreground.  The background is a subtle, out-of-focus warm wooden table.  The color palette is warm and inviting, with earthy tones from the wood, the vibrant orange and green of the garnish, and the golden-brown hues of the spring rolls. The overall composition should feel appetizing and inviting, like a close-up shot from a food blog or cookbook.
