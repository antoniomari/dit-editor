Generate an image of a serene waterfront scene at sunset or sunrise. 


**Scene:** The main focus is a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water. The bridge is light grey or concrete-colored, with distinct supports and a straight, horizontal design. In the background, a few city buildings are visible, including a tall, rectangular building that appears to be a hotel or office building. The buildings are dark silhouettes against the sky. The foreground is a gently sloping sandy beach or shore, which is close to the viewer, occupying about the bottom third of the frame. There is a hint of small boats or vessels near the bridge on the water.


**Lighting:** The lighting suggests either a sunset or sunrise. The sky is a blend of soft pastel colors, mostly muted blues, pinks, and oranges around the horizon, gradually transitioning to a deeper blue towards the zenith. The clouds are wispy and spread across the sky; some are a lighter color and others are darker. The light casts soft, gentle shadows on the scene, and there is a slight reflection of the sky and bridge in the calm water.  The light should be soft and diffused, avoiding harsh shadows.


**Style:** The overall style should be photorealistic, with a slightly muted and dreamy feel. The colors should be slightly desaturated, giving a calm and peaceful vibe. The image should have a sense of depth and perspective, with the beach in the foreground leading the eye to the bridge and buildings in the background. The water should be relatively smooth with a slight motion blur to emphasize calmness.


**Composition:** The composition is based on a horizontal orientation. The bridge is centrally positioned, acting as a strong horizontal line cutting across the image. The foreground beach helps to ground the image, drawing the viewer's attention in. The skyline with buildings adds some visual interest in the background without being overwhelming. The overall composition should feel balanced and peaceful.


The focus should be sharp on the bridge and relatively sharp on the buildings, but the sand in the foreground can have a slightly shallower depth of field for effect. The overall mood should convey tranquility and a sense of place.
