Generate an image of a tranquil waterfront scene at sunset.

**Scene:** The focal point is a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water.  The bridge is relatively low to the horizon, and its structure is detailed but not overly complex – think clean lines and a slightly elevated roadway.  Behind the bridge, a cityscape is visible, featuring a prominent, somewhat tall, rectangular building that resembles a hotel or office building.  Other smaller buildings are visible but less defined; they’re mostly silhouettes against the sky.  In the foreground, a sandy beach or shoreline gently slopes towards the water.  The water itself is relatively still, with subtle reflections of the bridge and sky.

**Lighting:** The scene is bathed in the soft, warm hues of a late sunset or early sunrise.  The sky is a blend of pastel pinks, oranges, and purples, transitioning to deeper blues and grays towards the zenith.  The clouds are cumulus – somewhat puffy and spread out, not overly dense or dramatic.  The lighting should create a peaceful and serene atmosphere; the sun itself should be below the horizon but casting a warm glow.  There should be no harsh shadows, just soft transitions in light.

**Style:** The overall style should be photorealistic, aiming for a slightly muted and calm color palette.  The image should have a sense of tranquility and stillness; almost a dreamy quality.  The focus should be sharp on the bridge and the shoreline, while the background elements could have a slightly softer focus.  The long exposure effect should be subtle, creating a slight blur in the water's reflections without making them completely indistinct. The overall look should be reminiscent of a professionally shot landscape photograph, with a calm and inviting feel.

**Composition:** The composition should be a wide shot, with the bridge as the central element, stretching across the majority of the horizontal frame. The foreground beach occupies approximately the lower third of the image, providing a sense of perspective and grounding the scene.  The cityscape is in the middle-ground and serves as a supporting element, balanced with the soft sky behind. The water acts as a natural separator between the foreground, mid-ground, and background. The entire scene should feel balanced and harmonious.
