Generate an image of a serene park scene with a modern, multi-story building seemingly floating in the air above the trees.

**Background:**

* The background should depict a park-like setting.  A wide expanse of lush green grass dominates the lower two-thirds of the image.  A paved pathway runs horizontally across the middle ground, separating the grass from a line of mature trees. The trees are primarily evergreen, dark green, and fairly uniformly spaced, creating a neat, slightly formal feel. In the far background, there is a hint of additional buildings or structures, but they're indistinct and should remain blurry to maintain the focus on the foreground and the floating building.  The sky should be a clear, light blue with few, if any, clouds.

**Foreground Element:**

* The foreground features a modern, multi-story building.  The building is predominantly white and light gray with accents of dark gray and a hint of light blue or teal on a side panel. It has many vertically stacked rectangular windows, many appearing yellow-gold on the portion visible in the image due to lighting or material. The building's appearance suggests a contemporary office or apartment building.  It appears to be a composite of two connected sections, slightly offset.

**Interaction:**

* The building is positioned in the mid-ground, hovering above the tree line, slightly angled to the left. It appears to be floating or levitating, creating a surreal juxtaposition with the otherwise realistic park setting. The building's shadow should not be cast on the ground below; this helps enhance the floating effect.

*  In the immediate foreground (bottom right), a person is seated on a tree stump, facing away from the viewer and toward the surreal scene.  The person's back is visible, and they are wearing a simple maroon t-shirt and dark-colored pants.  They appear relaxed and contemplative. Their presence anchors the scene and allows for a comparison of scale with the giant floating structure.

**Overall Changes:**

The addition of the floating building radically alters the mood of the original background, which would have been calm and ordinary.  The composite image creates a dreamlike, almost fantastical atmosphere, contrasting the tranquility of the park with the surreal element of the building in the sky. The color palette should be primarily natural and muted, with the exception of the buildingâ€™s light blue and yellow accent colors. The overall lighting should be soft and natural, indicative of daytime.
