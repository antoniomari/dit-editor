Generate an image in the style of Vincent van Gogh's Impressionism. The scene is a landscape featuring a field of vibrant green grass speckled with small, colorful flowers, predominantly white and yellow.  The foreground is dominated by this field, extending across the bottom third of the image.

In the middle ground, a dark green line represents a hedgerow or boundary separating the field from a line of trees. These trees are rendered with short, visible brushstrokes in varying shades of green, suggesting springtime foliage.  Several prominent trees, with visible, slightly pinkish blossoms, stand out against the background. Their branches are depicted with dynamic, swirling brushstrokes. A small, rectangular, orange-toned building is visible behind the trees.

The background is dominated by a dramatic, expressive sky filled with large, swirling clouds. The clouds are primarily shades of gray, purple, and light blue, with visible texture and movement created using thick, impasto brushstrokes. The colors are slightly muted, suggesting an overcast, yet not entirely gloomy, day. The sky occupies the top two-thirds of the composition.


The overall composition is horizontal, emphasizing the expansive nature of the field and sky. The color palette is predominantly green, blue, and purple, with accents of orange and pink in the blossoms and building.  The lighting is diffused, with no harsh shadows, suggesting an overcast or slightly hazy day. The style should be distinctly painterly, with visible brushstrokes that contribute to the texture and energy of the piece. The brushwork should be vigorous and expressive, reflecting Van Gogh's signature style. The overall mood should be serene but with a sense of dramatic energy from the sky.
