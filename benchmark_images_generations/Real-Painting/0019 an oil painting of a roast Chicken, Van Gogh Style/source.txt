Generate an image in a bold, stylized, almost naive painting style reminiscent of folk art.  The scene depicts a simple table setting on a green and white checkered tablecloth.  

The color palette should be vibrant but slightly muted, think slightly desaturated but still highly saturated colors.  The colors should appear as if applied in broad strokes, not blended seamlessly.

**Scene Elements:**

* **Tablecloth:**  A green and white checkered tablecloth forms the backdrop. The checks are roughly rendered, appearing slightly uneven and not perfectly aligned.

* **Tableware:**  A light blue teacup filled with dark brown tea sits on a matching light blue saucer.  A purple teapot with a slightly bulbous body rests on the tablecloth, slightly off-center. A pink plate holds a dark brown cake or pudding, a small, rectangular object. A yellow mug is partially visible in the upper left corner.  A fork or knife is also present next to the cake, lying on the pink plate.

* **Chairs:** Two wooden chairs are visible in the background, slightly out of focus. One chair is painted light blue, the other a warm, yellowish brown. The wood grain is not realistically rendered; instead, the chairs are painted with simplified blocky forms and visible brushstrokes.

* **Background:** The background behind the chairs is suggestive of a wall or building exterior, rendered in tones of grey and muted blues and whites. The background is blurry and less detailed than the foreground elements, drawing focus to the table setting.

**Lighting:**

The lighting is somewhat diffuse, suggesting soft, natural light. The shadows are not harsh or defined but are visible enough to give a sense of depth to the scene. There is a slight suggestion of highlights on the surfaces of the objects, particularly the teapot and teacup.


**Style:**

The style should be heavily influenced by folk art and naive painting. Brushstrokes should be visible and expressive. The forms are simplified, and the colors are not blended perfectly; think of visible brushstrokes and a slightly rough texture.  There should be a slightly childlike simplicity and directness in the representation of objects.  The overall effect should be whimsical and engaging.
