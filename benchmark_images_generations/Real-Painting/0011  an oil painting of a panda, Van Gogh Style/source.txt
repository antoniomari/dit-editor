Generate an image in the style of Vincent van Gogh, specifically evoking his use of impasto and expressive brushstrokes.  The scene is a landscape featuring a foreground of a vibrant green field speckled with small, brightly colored wildflowers, rendered with short, visible brushstrokes of varying thickness.

The middle ground shows a dark green horizontal line representing a hedgerow or low fence separating the field from a line of trees. These are stylized as somewhat spindly, with visible texture and light green and yellow-green leaves.  Three prominent trees, slightly taller than the others, are more detailed and stand out in the middle ground.  They feature a mix of light and dark greens and hints of pale pink/red blossoms in their canopies.  Behind these trees, a low, flat building, perhaps a farm structure, is visible. It is rendered in a simple, block-like manner, using predominantly muted orange and blue tones.

The background is dominated by a dramatic, turbulent sky filled with large, swirling clouds. The clouds are painted with thick, swirling brushstrokes in shades of purple, grey, white and light blue. They are expressive and dynamic, suggesting a breezy or potentially stormy atmosphere.  The sky is a pale blue between the clouds, with subtle hints of blue and light green in the spaces.  The clouds' forms are not realistically depicted but rather are emphasized for their textural and emotive qualities.

The lighting is diffuse, suggesting an overcast day, though some areas have brighter highlights to emphasize the texture and the three-dimensionality of the clouds and the trees.  The overall palette is a blend of earthy greens, the vibrant colors of the wildflowers, and the expressive blues and purples of the sky. The composition uses a horizontal line to divide the scene into sky and earth, creating a balance between the dramatic sky and the peaceful foreground. The focus is slightly more on the sky and clouds, emphasizing their expressive power.  The overall image should have the characteristic texture and energy of a Van Gogh painting.
