Generate an image in the style of Vincent van Gogh, depicting a landscape under a dramatic, cloudy sky.

**Scene:** The scene is a pastoral landscape featuring a foreground of a vibrant green field speckled with small, colorful flowers, possibly wildflowers.  In the midground, there's a dark green strip representing a ditch or boundary line, separating the field from a row of blossoming trees. These trees are somewhat stylized, with visible brushstrokes emphasizing their texture and shape. They are light-colored, possibly white or pale green, with hints of pink or reddish blossoms, suggesting springtime. Behind the trees is a simple rectangular building, rendered in shades of orange and blue, possibly a farmhouse or barn.  Further back, a darker line of trees and shrubs completes the horizon.

**Sky:** The sky dominates the upper two-thirds of the image. It's filled with large, expressive clouds rendered with thick, swirling brushstrokes.  The clouds are predominantly shades of grey, purple, and light blue, with hints of white where the light breaks through.  The clouds are not uniform; some are denser and darker, suggesting a potential storm or impending rain.  The overall effect should be one of movement and drama.

**Lighting:** The lighting is natural, with the light seemingly coming from a diffuse source, possibly slightly behind the clouds. This results in a generally soft illumination across the landscape, although the darker clouds cast shadows and provide contrast. The light should subtly highlight the flowers in the foreground and the blossoms on the trees.

**Style:** The style must be clearly reminiscent of Van Gogh's post-impressionist work. This means utilizing distinct, visible brushstrokes of varying thickness and direction. The colors should be bold and slightly exaggerated, not strictly realistic.  The impasto technique should be apparent, with paint seemingly applied thickly.  The overall effect should be expressive and emotionally charged rather than photorealistic.

**Composition:** The composition is relatively straightforward, with a clear horizontal division between the sky and the landscape. The placement of the trees and building in the midground leads the eye across the image. The color contrast between the vivid green of the field and the dramatic sky should create visual tension. The perspective is somewhat flattened, typical of Van Gogh's work, emphasizing the two-dimensionality of the canvas.
