Generate an image in a bold, stylized, almost naive painting style reminiscent of folk art.  The scene is a table setting featuring a still life of tea time elements.

**Scene:**

The main focus is a green checkered tablecloth upon which sits a vibrant blue teacup and saucer filled with dark brown tea.  Next to it, a purple teapot with a slightly bulbous body and a spout sits. A small, slightly burnt-looking baked good, possibly a muffin or a small cake, rests on a bright pink plate with a folded blue napkin or paper liner underneath. A silver knife and fork are partially visible beside the baked good.  In the background, two wooden chairs are visible; one is a bright blue, the other is a golden-brown. A mustard yellow mug is partially visible on the left edge of the table near the blue chair.

**Lighting:**

The lighting should be soft and diffused, with no harsh shadows. The light source appears to be coming from slightly above and to the front, casting subtle hints of shadow under the objects.

**Style:**

The style should be characterized by thick, visible brushstrokes and a simplified approach to form. Colors should be bold and slightly unrealistic, with a focus on flat planes and contrasting hues.  The overall feel should be playful and slightly whimsical. There should be a noticeable texture to the paint application, suggesting impasto. The background is textured like a rough painting, with pale gray and muted shades, representing perhaps a wall.

**Composition:**

The composition is centered on the teacup and teapot, with the other elements arranged around them to create a balanced and visually appealing scene.  The chairs in the background add depth and context without overpowering the main focus. The overall composition is relatively close-up but gives a sense of the larger space.


**Specific Details:**

* **Teacup:**  Bright, almost electric blue, with a slightly rounded shape. The tea inside should be a dark brown.
* **Teapot:**  A deep purple, almost plum-colored. The handle and spout should be clearly defined.
* **Baked Good:** A slightly irregular shape, indicating homemade quality. Its color should be a dark brown with a subtle suggestion of caramelization.
* **Tablecloth:** A soft, grassy green with a pronounced check pattern.
* **Chairs:**  Simple wooden chairs, one blue and one a slightly darker brownish-yellow.  The wood grain shouldn't be detailed, but suggested with short brushstrokes.
* **Mug:** A simple yellow color, slightly muted.


The final image should convey a feeling of warmth, simplicity, and a slightly nostalgic charm. The overall aesthetic should be bright, joyful, and slightly childlike, reflecting the naive painting style.
