Generate an image in the style of a loose, impressionistic oil painting. The scene depicts a cityscape, reminiscent of the New York City skyline, viewed from across a body of water.

**Scene:**  The main focus is a row of stylized skyscrapers and buildings of varying heights and pastel colors.  The One World Trade Center is clearly identifiable as the tallest building, with a distinctive spire.  Other buildings are represented with blocks of color suggesting their shapes and heights, but without precise detail. There's a suggestion of greenery at the base of the buildings, along the waterfront. A few small boats are subtly present on the water in front of the cityscape.

**Lighting:** The lighting is soft and diffused, suggesting a slightly overcast day.  There are no harsh shadows; the light is even across the scene. The sky is a pale, light blue with subtle hints of white, almost hazy.  The light reflects subtly on the water, creating a gentle ripple effect.

**Style:** The style should be painterly and impressionistic, with visible brushstrokes and a slightly textured surface. Colors should be muted pastels, predominantly blues, pinks, and light browns/beiges.  The buildings should be rendered with visible impasto, with the paint applied thickly in places to create texture.  Edges should be soft and undefined in many areas, contributing to the impressionistic effect.  Avoid sharp lines; favor soft transitions between colors and shapes.  There should be a visible sense of the artist's hand in the application of paint.

**Composition:** The cityscape should occupy most of the canvas, with the water taking up the bottom third. The composition is horizontal, focusing on the cityscape's broad expanse. The One World Trade Center acts as a visual anchor, drawing the eye to the center of the composition.  The reflection of the cityscape in the water should be subtle and less detailed than the cityscape itself.  The overall effect should be peaceful and contemplative.
