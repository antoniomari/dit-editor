Generate an image of a cityscape reflected in calm water.  The style should be painterly, with visible brushstrokes and a slightly impressionistic feel. The overall color palette is muted, leaning towards blues, grays, and pale pinks.

The background is a serene, light blue-grey sky with subtle texture suggesting clouds or atmospheric haze.  This sky is slightly textured to give it a painted quality, not completely smooth.

The foreground consists of a cityscape composed of various buildings rendered in a cubist-inspired style with flat planes and simplified forms. The buildings vary in height and color. Some are predominantly grey and blue-toned, representing office buildings or skyscrapers, with large windows reflecting the light.  Others are colored with pastel shades like pale pink, peach, and muted yellows, possibly representing residential or commercial buildings of a different architectural style.  There is a noticeable variation in the rendering of the buildings; some are crisp and detailed while others appear more abstract, almost collage-like.  

The buildings are grouped together tightly, suggesting a dense urban area.  A body of relatively calm water sits in the foreground, reflecting the cityscape with some distortion. The reflection is not perfectly sharp but shows a suggestion of the cityscape, indicating a tranquil setting.

Finally, there's a band of muted green suggesting trees or vegetation along the waterfront between the buildings and water, which adds a touch of nature to the urban scene. This greenery is painterly and indistinct, adding to the overall impressionistic mood.

The overall impression should be one of a peaceful yet vibrant city viewed from across a body of water at a distance, presented through the lens of a painterly collage.  The style should be reminiscent of a modern interpretation of an urban landscape with a slight sense of whimsy in the color choices and architectural simplification.
