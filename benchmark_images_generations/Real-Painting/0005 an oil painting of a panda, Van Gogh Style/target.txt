Generate an image of a giant panda lying down in a field. The panda should be positioned in the lower center of the image, slightly angled to the right.  Its fur should be realistically textured, showing both the black and white patches distinctly.  The panda's expression should be neutral or slightly curious.

The background should be a stylized impressionist landscape painting in the style of Vincent van Gogh.  The style should feature visible brushstrokes, vibrant colors, and a somewhat swirling effect, particularly in the clouds.  The sky should be a mix of blues and purples, with large, expressive clouds dominating the upper two-thirds of the background.  The lower third should depict a grassy field dotted with small, flowering plants,  and several stylized trees, painted in a similar impressionistic style.  The trees should be somewhat simplified in form, with visible brush strokes suggesting leaves and branches. A small building, slightly suggesting a farmhouse, can be included in the middle ground.

The panda should appear to be lying naturally in the field, with no obvious digital seams or unnatural blending between it and the background. The overall lighting should be soft and natural, with the scene feeling peaceful and slightly whimsical. The contrast between the realistic panda and the stylized background should be deliberate and visually striking. The scale of the panda should be large enough to emphasize its presence within the smaller scale of the background painting, perhaps suggesting an element of surrealism.
