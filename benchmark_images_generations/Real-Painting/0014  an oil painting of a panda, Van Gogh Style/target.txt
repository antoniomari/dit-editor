Generate an image in the style of a Van Gogh painting.  The background should depict a landscape similar to "Wheat Field with Cypresses," but with a lighter, more pastel color palette.  Focus on the characteristic impasto technique of thick, visible brushstrokes in swirling clouds, and slightly stylized trees and vegetation. The sky should be a light blue with voluminous, puffy clouds in shades of lavender, light gray, and white.  The ground should be a field of grass with hints of wildflowers in varying shades of greens, yellows, and white.  There should be several small, stylized trees, reminiscent of cypress trees, scattered across the landscape, rendered with bold, short strokes.  In the middle ground, suggest a small, simple building with a dark orange-brown hue.

In the foreground, place a young giant panda, positioned slightly off-center, towards the bottom third of the image. The panda should appear realistically rendered in contrast to the painterly background, but still with a slightly softened, less crisp quality. It should be lying down, appearing calm, perhaps slightly hunched over, as if it's eating or resting in the grass. The panda's fur should have distinct black and white patches, with subtle shading to show depth.  It should be slightly obscured by the foreground grass, so that parts of its body might be partially hidden.  The panda should not blend perfectly with the background, but rather interact with it; the panda's fur could subtly pick up some of the colors of the background grass in a way that enhances the overall artistic blending of both elements.  Make sure the panda doesn't appear to be digitally cut-and-pasted, but rather subtly integrated into the scene, consistent with a "painted-in" look.  The overall effect should be a whimsical juxtaposition of realism and impressionism, with the cute panda adding a charming, slightly unexpected element to the classic Van Gogh landscape.
