Generate an image of a cityscape reflected in calm water, styled like a stylized painting.  The background should depict a slightly impressionistic view of a city skyline, reminiscent of New York City, with buildings rendered in muted pastel colors of peach, light blue, beige, and pale orange.  The buildings are varied in height and shape, with a tall, slender skyscraper (similar to One World Trade Center) prominent in the center, slightly leaning to the right.  The style should be painterly, with visible brushstrokes and a slightly textured appearance.  The overall color palette of the background should be soft and hazy, suggestive of a slightly overcast day.  The water at the bottom should be a light, greyish-blue, reflecting the skyline with a muted, blurry impression of the buildings.  A thin line of dark green represents a waterfront area in front of the buildings.

In the foreground, overlay a section of a modern, high-rise apartment building, rendered in a more realistic style with sharp lines and dark gray and off-white coloring.  The building should be situated on the right-hand side of the image, partially overlapping the painted cityscape, so that it appears to be a separate, more contemporary structure added to the existing scene. The foreground building should have a more defined and less impressionistic style than the background cityscape, creating a clear contrast.  The water's reflection should also incorporate this additional building.  The juxtaposition should make the modern building stand out against the soft, painted backdrop. The overall mood should be one of quiet contemplation, contrasting the organic style of the background with the sharp, clean lines of the foreground building. The final image should maintain a balance between the different art styles, combining the impressionistic and realistic elements to create a cohesive, yet striking composition.
