Generate an image in a vibrant, stylized Post-Impressionist or Fauvist style. The scene depicts a simple table setting on a green checkered tablecloth.  The main focus is on a still life arrangement of tea items and a pastry.

**Scene:**

* **Tablecloth:** A green tablecloth with a distinct checkered pattern. The squares should be slightly irregular and painted with visible brushstrokes, giving a textured feel.  The green should be a varied hue, with some areas appearing darker or lighter.
* **Teapot:** A purple teapot, slightly rounded in shape with a short spout and handle. The color should be a rich, slightly desaturated purple, with visible brushstrokes indicating texture and depth.
* **Teacup & Saucer:** A bright blue teacup filled with dark brown tea. The cup is slightly rounded and sits on a matching blue saucer.  The saucer should show similar brushstrokes as the teapot.  Both teacup and saucer should have a slight reflective quality.
* **Pastry:** A brown pastry, resembling a small cake or pudding in a paper container, sits on a pink plate. The pastry is dark brown with slightly lighter highlights, rendered with thick, textured brushstrokes.
* **Plate:** The plate under the pastry is a bright, saturated pink with irregular white or light pink markings, giving a slightly imperfect appearance.
* **Cutlery:** A dark grey or black knife and fork are subtly placed on the plate under the pastry. They should appear slightly painterly, not photorealistic.
* **Background:** Two chairs are visible in the background, one light blue and one yellow-brown. Both chairs should have simple, slightly abstract designs indicated by brushstrokes, not realistic detail.  The background should suggest a room with muted grey-toned walls, with a blurry, indistinct quality to emphasize the still life in the foreground.  The background should be out of focus but still visible.

**Lighting:**

The lighting should be soft and diffused, likely from an unseen source slightly above and to the side.  There should be subtle shadows under the objects to give a sense of depth and form. The shadows themselves should be painterly rather than harshly defined.


**Style:**

The overall style should mimic the bold brushstrokes and color choices of Post-Impressionism or Fauvism.  Colors should be bold and slightly exaggerated, and lines should be visible and expressive.  The texture of the paint should be evident, adding to the overall artistic feel.

**Composition:**

The composition should be slightly off-center, drawing the eye first to the teacup and then across to the pastry.  Use the rule of thirds to guide the placement of the objects. The tablecloth should provide a pleasing visual anchor to help balance the composition. A small, yellow-gold mug sits partially visible on the left of the table, almost entirely shadowed.
