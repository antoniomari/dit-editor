Generate an image of a minimalist living room scene depicted in a line drawing style.  The background consists of a simple line drawing of a couch with a single pillow, positioned centrally.  To the left of the couch is a small, similarly drawn side table with a bottle and a small object (possibly a glass) on its surface, and a stack of books on a lower shelf.  To the upper right, a simple line drawing of a hanging cage-style light fixture is present.

The foreground element is a white microwave oven, rendered realistically, placed on a simple shelf above the couch. The shelf is drawn in a basic line style, consistent with the rest of the background. The microwave is positioned centrally, slightly above and over the couch,  and its inclusion adds a jarring, unexpected element to the otherwise calm, simplistic nature of the scene.  The microwave's realistic rendering contrasts with the purely line art style of the rest of the image. The overall lighting is even and neutral. Ensure the lines are clean and consistent throughout, maintaining the minimalist aesthetic.  The background should be white.
