Generate a minimalist line drawing in the style of a hand-drawn architectural sketch. The scene depicts a living room with a simple, clean aesthetic.

The central focus is a two-seater sofa, rendered with smooth, slightly curved lines suggesting upholstery.  A single pillow rests in the center. The sofa's legs are not explicitly detailed; instead, it sits directly on the floor.  To the left is a small, slender side table with a bottle and a glass resting on it and a small stack of books on the lower shelf.  Above the sofa, a simple shelf spans the width of the image, holding a small globe or decorative ball, several books, some small objects that could be candles or small decorative items and a small potted tree.  A square framed picture hangs centrally above the shelf. To the right, a rectangular cage-like pendant light hangs from the ceiling. The ceiling and floor are implied, not explicitly drawn.  All lines are consistent in thickness, suggesting a single, quick, confident stroke.

The overall lighting is neutral and even, creating no significant shadows or highlights, consistent with a simple line drawing.  The style should evoke a sense of serenity and clean lines, emphasizing simplicity and functionality. The composition is centered, with the sofa as the focal point, creating a balanced and symmetrical arrangement. The absence of color and texture reinforces the minimalist approach. The overall feeling should be calming and uncluttered.
