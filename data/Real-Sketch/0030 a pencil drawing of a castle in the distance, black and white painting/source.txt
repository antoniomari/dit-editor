Generate a grayscale image in a pencil sketch style, reminiscent of a child's drawing yet possessing a degree of artistic finesse. The scene depicts a tranquil rural landscape at either dawn or dusk.

**Foreground:** A person, simplified in form, sits beneath a large, leafy tree to the left, playing a flute or similar instrument. The tree's trunk is thick, and its branches spread widely, casting a slight shadow.  Grass and small, stylized plants surround the tree's base and the figure. The ground is gently sloped toward a calm body of water.

**Midground:** A gently curving river or stream dominates the midground.  Its surface is relatively smooth, reflecting a pale sky. Two small, simple houses with pitched roofs are visible on the far bank, slightly to the right of the center.  A few palm trees stand near the houses. A small boat, stylized like a canoe or small raft, with a single person in it, is on the water, moving away from the houses and toward the viewer.

**Background:** The background is a soft, hazy sky suggesting either sunrise or sunset, with subtle shading indicating a light source rising or setting behind a distant, indistinct hill or landmass.  More trees, simplified in form, are scattered in the background, keeping the focus on the main elements of the scene.

**Lighting:** The light source is soft and diffused, indicating either early morning or late evening. The light seems to come from behind the viewer and to the left,  creating subtle shadows under the tree and behind the houses. There are no harsh shadows.  The overall tone is peaceful and serene.

**Style:** The style should mimic a pencil sketch.  Use varying shades of gray to create depth and texture, with cross-hatching or stippling to suggest texture in the tree's leaves, the grass, and the clothing of the seated figure.  Lines are slightly uneven, giving a hand-drawn feel, avoiding perfect symmetry and uniformity. Avoid strong contrasts and keep the overall feel soft and muted. The overall impression should be peaceful, nostalgic, and slightly whimsical.
