Generate an image depicting a serene pencil sketch landscape with a digitally added element.

The base image is a grayscale pencil sketch of a tranquil riverside scene.  The style is somewhat simplistic and illustrative, not photorealistic.  The scene includes:

* **A large, leafy tree:** Located in the lower left quadrant, with a wide, full crown and relatively simple, almost stylized, branching. The tree is drawn with varying shades of gray to create depth and volume.
* **A calm river or lake:** Meandering through the center, reflecting the muted light of the scene. The banks are gently sloping and subtly textured.
* **A small figure:** Seated beneath the tree, appearing to play a flute or similar instrument. The figure is also drawn in a simple, somewhat cartoonish style consistent with the rest of the sketch.  They're dressed in loose-fitting clothing.
* **A few stylized palm trees or similar vegetation:** Scattered along the riverbank, adding more depth to the background. The vegetation is less detailed than the main tree.
* **A small boat:**  On the river, near the right middle ground, with a person appearing to be rowing or steering. The boat is depicted simply as a small vessel, with no great level of detail.

**Foreground Element:**

The digitally added element is a photograph or high-resolution image of a church, specifically what looks like a Gothic or similar style building, illuminated at night.  This is a brightly lit image contrasting strongly with the grayscale sketch. The church is positioned in the middle ground of the drawing, on the opposite bank of the river from the seated figure. It's fairly large in comparison to the sketch's scale, almost dominating the mid-ground. The lighting on the church should create a strong contrast with the muted tones of the pencil sketch.  The church's placement in the original sketch is meant to be integrated visually, implying that it is part of the scene. Ensure a smooth blend between the edges of the church image and the pencil sketch background.


The overall effect should be a peaceful, somewhat dreamlike composition where the bright, detailed church acts as a focal point, contrasting with the quiet, hand-drawn landscape. Maintain the original style of the pencil sketch while making the added church image look convincingly integrated into the scene. The contrast in styles and color palettes should be clearly visible.
