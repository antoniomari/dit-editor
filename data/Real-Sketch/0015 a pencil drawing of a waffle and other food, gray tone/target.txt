Generate a grayscale still life image in the style of a charcoal drawing.  The background should depict a classic still life arrangement: a partially crushed aluminum soda can lying on its side, a wine glass (partially filled, reflecting light subtly), and a chocolate bar lying flat on a tablecloth-like surface. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating subtle shading and highlights. The overall tone should be muted and slightly melancholic.

The foreground element is a single heart-shaped waffle, rendered in realistic detail with a warm, contrasting color palette (brown, tan, light beige) against the monochrome background.  It should be placed near the bottom center, slightly overlapping the chocolate bar and floating in space just above the table surface. The waffle should appear as if it has been lightly dusted with powdered sugar, creating a textural contrast with the smooth surfaces of the other objects.

The waffle's placement should subtly alter the mood of the original scene by introducing a feeling of unexpected sweetness and perhaps a hint of whimsy or nostalgia. The contrast between the grayscale and the warm tones of the waffle should be striking. The waffle's slightly out-of-place nature emphasizes that it is a superimposed element.  The perspective should maintain consistency across the entire image, with the waffle following the same perspective and lighting as the existing objects, enhancing the seamless integration, even though it's clearly added.  There should be a partial view of a reddish-brown apple slightly behind and to the left of the waffle, partially obscured by it.
