Generate a grayscale image in the style of a realistic pencil sketch. The scene depicts a tranquil rural landscape at either dawn or dusk.

**Scene:** The focal point is a person sitting under a large, leafy tree, appearing to play a flute or similar instrument.  The tree is positioned slightly off-center to the left, creating a natural leading line towards the rest of the scene.  The person is seated on the bank of a calm river or lake, which gently curves through the middle ground.  Two simple, stylized houses with pitched roofs are visible on the far bank, suggesting a small village.  Several palm trees stand near the houses. A small boat with a person rowing is on the river. The background includes a low hill or rise of land, and the sky is subtly shaded to suggest a sunrise or sunset. The foreground is slightly textured with short grass and some weeds around the tree base.

**Lighting:** The light source appears to be a low sun, either rising or setting.  This creates subtle shading and highlights across the landscape, particularly emphasizing the form of the tree and houses.  The lighting is soft and diffused, avoiding harsh shadows. There is a slight glow on the horizon.

**Style:** The image should have the look of a detailed pencil sketch, with varied shading techniques to create depth and texture. Use subtle hatching and cross-hatching to create shading on the tree and houses. The lines should be fairly smooth but not overly polished; some visible pencil strokes should be present to retain the handmade quality.  The overall style is peaceful and slightly romanticized, emphasizing the tranquility of the scene.  The style should mimic a drawing in a realistic style, but with a simplification of detail that borders on cartoonish simplicity, particularly with the houses and figures.


**Composition:**  The composition is balanced, with the tree anchoring the left side and the houses providing a counterbalance on the right. The river acts as a visual divider and a path guiding the eye. The entire scene should be contained within a rectangular frame, leaving some margin on all sides. The depth of field is shallow, with the focus on the person under the tree and the immediate foreground. The houses and far bank are less detailed to create depth.
