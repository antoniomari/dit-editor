Generate a grayscale image of a serene, idyllic rural landscape rendered in a slightly sketchy style.  The scene should feature a calm body of water, gently curving banks, and a few palm trees in the background.  A small, simple hut-like structure is situated near the water's edge on the right side of the frame.  A person is sitting under a large, leafy tree on the left, playing a flute. The tree's shade partially covers the person. A small boat with a single figure is visible on the water, near the hut.

Superimpose a detailed image of the Palace of Westminster (Houses of Parliament) in London, UK, onto the background.  The Palace should be centered in the image, replacing a section of the original background scene, just beyond the water and near the background hut.  It should be placed horizontally, to fill the space across the middle of the image but not overlapping the trees and person in the foreground. The Palace should appear as a color image, but with slightly muted and desaturated colors to blend somewhat with the grayscale scene while still retaining its architectural detail. The style of the Palace image should match the level of detail seen in the original sketch.

The overall effect should be a whimsical juxtaposition of a tranquil rural scene and the iconic Palace of Westminster, creating an unexpected and surreal composition. The grayscale of the original sketch should remain largely unchanged, with only the color of the Palace contrasting. The Palace should appear as if it is seamlessly integrated into the background of this otherwise monotone illustration, preserving the original feel of the sketch but adding a surprise element.
