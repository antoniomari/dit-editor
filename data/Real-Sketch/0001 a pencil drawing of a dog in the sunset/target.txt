Generate an image of a grayscale pencil sketch depicting a tranquil sunset scene over a body of water.  The sketch should feature tall grasses in the foreground, a calm water surface reflecting the large, low-hanging sun, and several small birds flying in the sky.  The style should be realistic, with meticulous shading and attention to detail in the texture of the grasses and the water.  The overall tone is serene and peaceful.

In the foreground of this sketch, place a photorealistic rendering of a young Border Collie puppy. The puppy is lying down, facing the viewer, and positioned in the center, approximately at the point where the sketched dock or wooden platform begins.  Its fur is predominantly white with black markings, and its expression is calm and friendly.  The puppy is slightly in front of the perspective of the drawing, creating a sense of depth. Ensure the puppy's fur is highly detailed and contrasts with the pencil shading of the background.  The overall lighting on the puppy should be consistent with the ambient light of the sunset in the sketched background. There should be a smooth blend between the photorealistic puppy and the sketched background so that it appears naturally integrated into the scene.  The image should be signed in a small, unobtrusive way in the bottom-right corner with the Japanese characters まゆ (Mayu).
