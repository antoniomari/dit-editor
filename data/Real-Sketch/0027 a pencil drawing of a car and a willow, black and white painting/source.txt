Generate a grayscale image in the style of a pencil sketch. The scene depicts a single, leafless tree positioned slightly off-center to the left.  The tree is rendered with a detailed, almost spidery network of branches, emphasizing its skeletal structure.  The branches are thin and intricately drawn, showing a lot of variation in thickness and direction. The tree's trunk is thick and textured, tapering slightly upwards.

The background features rolling hills, rendered using hatching and cross-hatching techniques to suggest depth and form.  The lines used for the hills are longer and more fluid than those used for the tree, creating a contrast in texture. The hills appear to gently slope down towards a body of water, suggested by softly rendered horizontal lines indicating a calm surface.  There's a subtle suggestion of a shoreline where the hills meet the water.

The foreground consists of a slightly sloped area of ground at the base of the tree, shown with short, parallel lines to imply grass or short vegetation.  Some stray lines suggest sparse ground cover near the tree's base and the far right of the image.

The overall lighting is soft and diffused, with no harsh shadows.  The style should evoke a sense of tranquility and solitude, resembling a contemplative landscape drawing. The composition should feel balanced, with the tree as a focal point against the broader background of hills and water. The overall grayscale palette should be relatively uniform, ranging from light gray to dark gray, creating a sense of subtle tonal variation without harsh contrasts. The image should have a slightly rough, textured appearance to mimic the look of a pencil sketch on paper.
