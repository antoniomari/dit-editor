Generate an image depicting a hand-drawn sketch of a landscape as the background.  The sketch should be in grayscale, using a style reminiscent of charcoal or pencil, with visible strokes and shading. The landscape features rolling hills, rendered with short, slightly uneven lines suggesting depth and texture.  A leafless, stylized tree is prominently featured in the foreground of the sketch; its branches are intricate and somewhat spindly, with a focus on the network of branches rather than leaf detail.  The lines defining the tree should be dark and slightly uneven, maintaining the hand-drawn aesthetic.  The ground beneath the tree is indicated by short, horizontal lines that suggest grass and earth.

Superimposed onto this hand-drawn landscape, in the lower right, is a photograph of a silver Vauxhall Astra hatchback. The car appears sharply defined and realistic, contrasting with the sketch-like background. It is positioned partially in the foreground of the sketch, appearing to be sitting in the grassy area near the base of the sketched tree.  The car should be placed slightly off-center, not directly in the middle of the image.  The car's license plate should be visible, but the details of the number plate are not crucial. The lighting on the car should be consistent with soft, diffuse outdoor light, implying a relatively overcast sky.  

The overall effect should be that of a photographic car seamlessly blended onto a hand-drawn sketch background, creating a surreal juxtaposition between the photographic realism of the car and the artistic expressiveness of the drawing.  The scale of the car should be appropriately sized relative to the sketched tree and landscape, not appearing overly large or small.
