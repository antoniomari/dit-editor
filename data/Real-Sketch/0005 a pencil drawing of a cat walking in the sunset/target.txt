Generate a grayscale image of a tranquil lakeside scene at sunset.  The style should be realistic pencil sketching, focusing on achieving a smooth gradation of tones for depth and atmosphere. The sky should feature a large, low-hanging sun, partially obscured by a hazy atmosphere.  Numerous small birds should be depicted flying across the sky, rendered with fine, light pencil strokes.

The foreground of the sketch includes tall grasses or reeds along the water's edge, depicted with varying line weights to suggest depth and texture. These should be rendered with slightly darker tones than the sky, and their reflections should be subtly visible on the calm water. A wooden dock or boardwalk extends from the bottom of the scene towards the water, shown with detailed, parallel lines indicating the wood grain.

The composite element is a short-haired, tri-colored (brown, white, and black) dog, specifically a corgi-type breed with short legs and a fluffy tail. It's positioned on the wooden dock, facing the sunset and lake. The dog's fur should be rendered with varying shades of gray to give it texture and form; ensure realistic detail is visible in its fur. It should be in focus, and the size should be appropriate for the scale of the background scene.  The dog should appear as though itâ€™s a photo that's been placed onto the pencil sketch.  The overall image should give the impression of the dog contemplating the beautiful sunset.

There is a small, faint, Japanese-style signature located in the bottom right corner of the background sketch beneath the dog and dock.  Maintain the grayscale palette throughout the entire image; the contrast between the realistic detail of the dog and the sketched background should be carefully balanced.
