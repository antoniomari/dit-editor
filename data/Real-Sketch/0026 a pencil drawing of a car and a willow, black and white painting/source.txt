Generate a grayscale image in a sketchy, impressionistic style reminiscent of a charcoal or pencil drawing.  The overall composition should feel serene and somewhat melancholic.

The central focus is a leafless, gnarled tree situated slightly off-center to the left. The tree's branches are intricate and detailed, with many thin, interwoven lines suggesting a sense of age and windswept texture.  The branches should extend outwards in a somewhat irregular, rounded shape, not perfectly symmetrical.  The trunk should be thick and textured, showing the grain of the wood.  The tree sits on a gently sloping hill rendered with short, parallel strokes suggestive of grass or earth.

In the background, rolling hills are depicted using longer, more sweeping strokes, creating a sense of depth and distance. The hills should have a slightly textured surface, but not overly detailed.  The lines should suggest layers and undulations.  Between the tree and the hills, hint at a calm body of water, suggested by subtle horizontal strokes showing a flat, reflective surface. The water should not be highly detailed; just a few gentle, slightly wavy lines to suggest its presence.

The lighting should be soft and diffused, suggesting an overcast day.  There are no harsh shadows; the light should be evenly distributed across the scene, creating a muted, peaceful mood. The overall tone should be predominantly light gray with darker values used sparingly to define forms and create contrast.  Avoid sharp lines; everything should have a slightly blurred, hazy quality enhancing the sketchy feel. The style should be loose and expressive, prioritizing the feeling over precise detail.  Small tufts of grass should be indicated near the base of the tree and on the foreground hill, using short, slightly irregular strokes.
