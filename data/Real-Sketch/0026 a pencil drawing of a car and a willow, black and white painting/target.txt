Generate an image depicting a stylized pencil sketch of a landscape as the background.  The style should be reminiscent of a quick, expressive drawing, with visible pencil strokes and shading.

The background should show a rolling hillside rendered with loose, textured lines suggesting distant mountains or hills. The style should be somewhat impressionistic, focusing on the overall feel rather than photorealistic detail.  In the foreground, slightly lower than the center, incorporate a  bare, gnarled tree. The tree is rendered in the same pencil sketch style as the background, but with more detailed branching and texture to emphasize its presence. The branches are thin and spread out, giving the impression of a windswept or winter tree. The ground should be suggested by short, light pencil strokes indicating grass or low-lying vegetation.

The foreground element is a vibrant, photorealistic red Dodge Viper convertible. The car is positioned near the base of the tree, slightly to the right, as if it has parked there.  It is sharply detailed and contrasted against the softer pencil-sketch style of the background. The car should appear slightly smaller than it would in real life, to suggest a sense of depth and scale. It should not look pasted or cut and pasted, but should feel as though it is in this pencil-sketch world, blending realistically with its surroundings.  The lighting on the car should be consistent with the subtle lighting implied in the pencil sketch background - avoid harsh lighting and shadows.

The overall effect should be a surreal juxtaposition of a realistic car and a stylized pencil sketch landscape, creating an interesting visual tension. The car's red color should stand out brilliantly against the grayscale of the sketch, drawing the eye immediately.  The interaction between the smooth, shiny surface of the car and the rough texture of the pencil lines should be clearly defined.
