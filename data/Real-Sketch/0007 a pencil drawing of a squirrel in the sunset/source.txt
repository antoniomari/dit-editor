Generate a grayscale image in a realistic pencil sketch style. The scene depicts a tranquil sunset over a calm body of water. 


**Scene:**

* **Foreground:** A wooden dock or pier composed of long, parallel planks extending from the bottom center to the midground. The planks should be rendered with detailed, closely spaced pencil strokes to show the wood grain texture.

* **Midground:** Tall, slender reeds or grasses grow along the edge of the water on both sides of the pier.  These should be rendered with varying densities of shading to create depth and volume. The reeds should be slightly reflective in the water. The water itself is relatively still, reflecting a subtle shimmer of the setting sun.

* **Background:** A large, partially obscured sun is setting just above the horizon. The sky is rendered with finely detailed, horizontal hatching to suggest clouds or a hazy atmosphere. Several small birds are flying across the sky, silhouetted against the sun and sky. The sky is darker near the horizon, gradually lightening towards the top.


**Lighting:**

* The primary light source is the setting sun, casting a soft, warm light that reflects subtly on the water.  The lighting should be even and diffused, without harsh shadows. The overall ambiance should be peaceful and serene.


**Style:**

* The style should mimic a highly detailed pencil sketch, emphasizing the use of hatching and cross-hatching techniques to create different values and textures.  The line work should be precise and consistent, creating a sense of realism within the pencil sketch medium.


**Composition:**

* The composition is centered around the setting sun, with the wooden pier acting as a leading line drawing the viewer's eye towards it. The reeds frame the scene on either side, further drawing the focus to the center. The overall arrangement is balanced and symmetrical, with a calm, peaceful atmosphere.

* Add a small, unobtrusive signature in a simple, elegant script in the bottom right corner that says "毛耳". (This should be rendered similarly to the rest of the image in terms of style).


The image should strive for a realistic representation, but within the limitations of a pencil sketch. The focus should be on the detailed rendering of textures and the creation of a serene and peaceful atmosphere.
