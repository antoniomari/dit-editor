Generate a grayscale image in the style of a realistic charcoal or graphite drawing.  The scene is a still life composition on a subtly textured, light-colored tablecloth.

**Objects:**

* **Wine Glass:** A stemmed wine glass, partially filled with a clear liquid, sits slightly off-center. The glass should be rendered with meticulous detail, showing reflections and refractions of light on its surface and within the liquid.  The stem and base should cast subtle shadows.
* **Crushed Can:** A partially crushed aluminum can lies on its side near the bottom left of the frame. The canâ€™s texture and dents should be clearly visible, with highlights and shadows indicating its three-dimensionality.
* **Chocolate Bar:** A chocolate bar, with a section broken off, rests on the tablecloth near the bottom right, slightly overlapping the shadow of the wine glass. Render the individual squares of the chocolate and the slight sheen of its surface.  Show a small break or crack in the bar.
* **Apple:** A red apple sits behind the wine glass, slightly out of focus and with less detailed rendering than the other objects. The apple should be a simple but realistically shaped form.

**Lighting:**

The lighting should be soft and diffused, emanating from a source slightly above and to the left of the composition.  This light should create strong chiaroscuro (strong contrasts between light and dark) effects, emphasizing the form and volume of each object. Subtle shadows should be cast by the objects onto the tablecloth.  There should be a gentle gradient in the background, darker at the top and gradually lightening towards the bottom.  Some light should be softly reflected on the tablecloth.

**Style:**

The overall style should be highly realistic, reminiscent of classical still-life drawings.  Pay close attention to value transitions and shading techniques to create a sense of depth and three-dimensionality.  Use a range of pencil strokes, from fine lines for detail to broader strokes for areas of shadow.  Texture should be suggested through varying the density and direction of strokes.


**Composition:**

The objects should be arranged to create a visually appealing composition, with a sense of balance and visual weight. The wine glass serves as a central focal point, while the other objects create a feeling of natural yet deliberate placement.  There should be sufficient negative space around the objects to allow for a balanced composition.
