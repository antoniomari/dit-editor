Generate a grayscale image in a style reminiscent of a detailed pencil sketch.  The scene depicts a tranquil rural landscape at either dawn or dusk.

**Foreground:** A person sits beneath a large, leafy tree, leaning against its trunk. They are playing a flute or similar instrument. The person is rendered with simple, yet expressive lines, focusing on their posture and the action of playing the instrument.  The grass around the tree is rendered with short, slightly textured strokes.

**Midground:** A calm river or lake meanders through the scene, reflecting the sky and a hint of the opposite bank. A small, simple boat with a single person in it is visible on the water. The banks of the river are gently sloping and covered with sparse vegetation.

**Background:** Two small, simple houses with pitched roofs are situated on a gentle rise on the far side of the water.  Behind the houses, several palm trees stand tall against a soft, hazy sky. The sky itself should show a hint of sunrise/sunset with subtle gradations of light and shadow, but mostly muted. The overall background should suggest a peaceful, somewhat remote setting.

**Lighting:** The lighting should be soft and diffused, suggesting either early morning or late evening light. There should be a gentle contrast between light and shadow, with the emphasis on soft transitions and the lack of harsh highlights.  The light should emanate primarily from the direction of the horizon, casting elongated shadows.

**Style:**  The style should be meticulously detailed, emulating a realistic pencil sketch.  Use varying shades of gray to create depth and texture.  Emphasize line work to define shapes and forms, with hatching and cross-hatching employed to create shading and volume.  Avoid sharp, defined lines except where needed for structural elements like the houses and boat. The overall feel should be peaceful and serene.  The level of detail should be consistent throughout the image, maintaining a balance between precision and a slightly loose, painterly quality.
