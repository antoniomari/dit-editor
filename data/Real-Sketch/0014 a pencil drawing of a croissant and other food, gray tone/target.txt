Generate a grayscale still life image in the style of a charcoal drawing. The background should depict a scene with a wine glass half-filled with white wine, a partially visible soda can lying on its side, and a bar of chocolate on a table, all rendered in varying shades of gray to create depth and texture. The lighting should be soft and diffused, with subtle shading to highlight the forms of the objects.

The foreground element is a single, golden-brown croissant, positioned slightly off-center, hovering just above the table near the chocolate bar.  The croissant should be sharply focused and brightly colored, creating a strong contrast against the grayscale background. Its texture should be detailed, showing the flaky layers and slight browning. The placement emphasizes its importance as a focal point.  The croissant casts no shadow.

The overall effect should be that of a surreal juxtaposition.  The monochromatic background and the realistic rendering of the wine glass, can and chocolate create a sense of calm, while the vividly colored, floating croissant adds an element of surprise and whimsy, breaking the monochrome mood and altering the expected composition of the still life.
