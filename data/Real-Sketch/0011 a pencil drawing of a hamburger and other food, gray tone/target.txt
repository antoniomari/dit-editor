Generate a grayscale image depicting a still life arrangement on a subtly textured white tablecloth.  The background consists of a meticulously rendered grayscale drawing, exhibiting a high degree of realism and shading, of a wine glass partially filled with a clear liquid, a partially crushed aluminum can lying on its side, and a bar of chocolate resting on the table. The wine glass is positioned slightly to the left of center, with the can resting near its base and the chocolate bar positioned lower right, partially overlapping the bottom of the scene. The background shading should suggest soft light coming from above and slightly to the left.  The overall style should be reminiscent of a classical still life drawing, employing careful attention to form, shadow, and texture.


In the foreground, sharply contrasted against the grayscale background, is a single cheeseburger. This hamburger should be rendered in full color, with accurate and detailed depiction of the sesame seed bun, juicy patty, melted cheese, tomato slice, and lettuce. It should appear to be floating slightly above the table, just in front of the chocolate bar and slightly to the right of the wine glass. This color element should create a sharp visual interruption, causing the viewerâ€™s eye to immediately notice it.  The burger should be illuminated from the same source as the background but should appear naturally brightly colored, not artificially lit.  The effect should be that of a digitally inserted, highly realistic element superimposed onto the monochromatic drawing. The contrast between the hyperrealistic, colorful burger and the carefully shaded monochrome background should be striking.
