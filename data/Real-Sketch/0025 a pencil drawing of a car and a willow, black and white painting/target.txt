Generate an image of a stylized pencil sketch landscape featuring a barren, gnarled tree in the foreground, and rolling hills in the background. The style should mimic a loose, expressive pencil sketch, with visible strokes and shading.

The hills should be depicted with parallel, slightly curved lines suggesting depth and distance, rendered in varying shades of gray.  The foreground should include a subtly textured ground plane around the base of the tree. Minimal sparse grass is visible in a few areas around the base. The tree itself should be central but slightly off to the left, its branches intricate and spreading,  almost cloud-like in its fullness.  The branches should be detailed but maintain the loose sketchy quality of the rest of the piece.

Into this sketch, composite a photorealistic image of a classic, blue Volkswagen Beetle. The car should be positioned in the lower right quadrant of the image, partially obscured by the lower branches of the tree. The car should appear to be parked on the ground plane of the sketch, appearing as a 3D object inserted into the 2D drawing.  The car should be facing slightly to the left of the frame.  Ensure a smooth blend of the car's shadow with the sketched ground plane to create a believable integration of the photograph into the pencil sketch.

The overall color scheme should be monochromatic, with the sketch rendered in various shades of gray, and the car a slightly desaturated, realistic blue. The contrast between the soft, sketch-like background and the crisp, detailed car should be noticeable yet harmonious.  The effect should be one of subtle juxtaposition and a hint of magical realism.
