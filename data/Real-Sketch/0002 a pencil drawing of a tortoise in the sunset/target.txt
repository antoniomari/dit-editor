Generate an image of a tranquil grayscale pencil sketch depicting a sunset over a calm body of water.  The water is depicted with subtle shading to suggest ripples.  Tall grasses, rendered with varying line weights to show depth and texture, line the water's edge on both sides.  A simple wooden dock or boardwalk extends from the foreground into the scene.  Several small birds are flying in the sky above the setting sun. The style should be realistic, aiming for a photorealistic pencil sketch quality.  

Then, add a detailed rendering of a tortoise, specifically a sulcata tortoise, positioned in the foreground on the wooden dock. The tortoise should be facing the sunset, its shell showing subtle textures and shading.  Its skin should be textured, and its eyes and mouth should be clearly defined.  The tortoise should appear slightly smaller compared to the overall size of the sketch, creating a sense of scale.  It's partially centered, but slightly closer to the lower left side of the image, in a naturalistic posture, neither perfectly straight nor overly posed.  The tortoise should not look obviously digitally added, but instead seem as though it organically belongs to the scene. The tortoise adds a touch of color contrast, since it is rendered in shades of brown, rather than simply grayscale, but the shading should be consistent with the overall aesthetic of the grayscale sketch.

The final image retains the artistic style of the grayscale pencil sketch as the dominant aesthetic element, with the tortoise serving as a focal point adding a touch of realistic detail and color. There should be a subtle signature, in a simple, elegant script style, in the lower right corner of the sketch.  The signature should read "きゅん".
