Generate an image of a still life scene rendered in a grayscale style, similar to a charcoal or pencil drawing.  The background should depict a monochromatic depiction of a wine glass partially filled with a clear liquid, resting on a surface next to a crushed aluminum can. The can is partially visible and appears somewhat rumpled. The overall lighting is soft and diffused.  The surface is subtly textured, suggesting a tablecloth or similar material.

The foreground element consists of three items:

1. **A cup of cappuccino:** A dark red cappuccino cup with the word "Campos" visible on its side, filled with a cappuccino featuring a detailed, realistic-looking crema. The cup should be positioned in front of and slightly to the right of the wine glass and can, almost floating slightly above the surface.  The crema should have a slightly lighter tone than the rest of the grayscale background, providing a subtle color contrast.

2. **A chocolate bar:**  A dark chocolate bar, broken in several places, rests on the surface of the table in the bottom right of the frame. The chocolate bar is positioned partially obscuring the lower portion of the wine glass. The texture of the chocolate should be slightly glossy, providing a contrast to the matte surface of the table.

3. **Increased Contrast/Shadows:** The interaction between the foreground and background should be subtly integrated, but the foreground elements, especially the cappuccino cup, should have a slightly higher contrast than the grayscale background to make it stand out.  Subtle shadows should be cast by the cup and chocolate bar onto the surface, providing depth.


The overall scene should give the impression that the cappuccino cup and chocolate bar have been digitally added to the existing grayscale image. The style should be realistic, aiming for a photorealistic effect within the grayscale limitations, maintaining consistency in lighting and shadow throughout the entire composition. The grayscale tones should range from light grays to dark grays, providing sufficient contrast and depth.
