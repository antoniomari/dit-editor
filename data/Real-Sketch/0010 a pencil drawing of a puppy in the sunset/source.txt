Generate a grayscale image in the style of a realistic pencil sketch, focusing on meticulous detail and shading.  The scene depicts a tranquil waterfront at sunset.

**Scene:** The main focus is a wooden dock or boardwalk stretching horizontally across the bottom third of the image.  It's composed of numerous closely spaced planks, rendered with consistent, parallel hatching to show the wood grain and texture. Beyond the dock, tall grasses or reeds rise from the water's edge on both sides, filling the middle ground.  These reeds are rendered with varying lengths and thicknesses, using a combination of hatching and stippling for texture, showing subtle variations in light and shadow.

The background features a large, low-hanging sun near the horizon, partially obscured by a hazy or cloudy sky.  The sun itself should have subtle shading to give it a three-dimensional feel, not just a flat circle.  Several small birds are flying in a loose formation across the upper portion of the sky.  The water is relatively calm, reflecting the setting sun with subtle ripples suggesting gentle movement.  The water's reflection should be less detailed than the sun or the reeds, providing contrast.

**Lighting:** The primary light source is the setting sun, casting a warm, soft light that illuminates the scene. The sky shows a gradient from darker at the top to lighter near the horizon. The shadows on the reeds and the dock should be consistent with the light source's position.  Pay close attention to the way the light catches the edges of the reeds and the texture of the wooden planks.

**Style:** The overall style should emulate a highly detailed pencil drawing, using varying pressures and techniques to create texture and depth.  Hatching is crucial for representing the wooden planks, reeds, and the sky.  Stippling can be used to enhance texture and create subtle shading variations.  The level of detail should be consistent throughout the image.

**Composition:** The image should maintain a balance between the foreground (dock), mid-ground (reeds and water), and background (sky and sun). The use of perspective is important; the dock should recede into the distance, with the planks converging towards a vanishing point. The composition should be horizontally oriented, emphasizing the tranquility and expansive nature of the landscape.

Add a small, subtly placed signature in the lower right corner using simple, elegant script-like text that reads "毛伊" (or a similar text to suggest an artist's signature).  The overall effect should be a peaceful, serene image that feels both realistic and artistic.
