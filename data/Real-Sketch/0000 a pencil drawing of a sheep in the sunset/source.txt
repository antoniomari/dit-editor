Generate a grayscale image in the style of a highly detailed pencil sketch.  The scene depicts a tranquil sunset over a calm body of water.

**Scene:** The foreground features a wide, wooden dock or boardwalk with planks rendered with meticulously detailed parallel lines suggesting the wood grain.  The planks run horizontally across the bottom third of the image, leading the eye towards the water.  Tall grasses or reeds, rendered with varying line weights to show depth and texture, fill the middle ground on both sides of the water, framing the sunset.  The water itself is relatively smooth, reflecting the large, low-hanging sun.  Several small birds are silhouetted against the sky, flying towards the setting sun.

**Lighting:** The primary light source is the large, round sun near the horizon, casting a soft, even light across the scene. The sky is rendered with subtle shading to suggest a twilight atmosphere; the shading is created using densely packed, very fine lines.  The water reflects the light of the setting sun, with slightly darker areas hinting at depth. The grasses and the dock are shaded realistically to suggest three-dimensionality.

**Style:**  The style should be hyperrealistic within the constraints of pencil sketching. The emphasis should be on precise line work and shading to create a sense of depth and texture.  The style should mimic the effect of using various pencil grades to create value and contrast.

**Composition:** The image is composed using a strong horizontal line created by the dock, creating a sense of stability and calm.  The vertical lines created by the grasses frame the sunset and the water, guiding the viewer's eye to the central focus: the sun setting over the water.  The overall composition is balanced and serene.  The image should have a slightly elevated perspective, as if the viewer is standing on the dock looking across the water towards the setting sun.  Add a small, unobtrusive artist's signature in a simple cursive script (using the kanji characters provided in the original image) in the bottom right corner.
