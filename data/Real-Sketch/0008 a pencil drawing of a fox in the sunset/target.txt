Generate a grayscale pencil sketch depicting a tranquil lakeside scene at sunset.  The style should be realistic, with careful attention to shading and texture to create depth. The scene includes a large, low-hanging sun partially obscured by the horizon, reflecting softly on the calm water.  Tall grasses or reeds line the water's edge, extending across the entire width of the image. A wooden dock or boardwalk stretches across the foreground, running parallel to the water and extending from the left edge to the right. The texture of the wood should be clearly visible through individual planks and subtle shading indicating the grain.  Several small birds are flying in the sky above the water.


In the foreground, and positioned centrally on the dock, place a realistic rendering of a red fox sitting. The fox should be facing the viewer, appearing alert but calm.  Its fur should be detailed with variations in shading to suggest texture and volume.  The fox should be rendered in a photorealistic style contrasting with the pencil-sketch style of the background, but still maintaining a sense of cohesiveness. The size of the fox should be approximately 1/3 to 1/2 the height of the background image. The fox's presence should slightly disrupt the otherwise peaceful serenity of the background; itâ€™s not fighting the background, but adding a lively element.  There should be a small, unobtrusive signature in the bottom right corner.  Ensure the lighting of the fox is consistent with the ambient lighting of the sunset scene.
