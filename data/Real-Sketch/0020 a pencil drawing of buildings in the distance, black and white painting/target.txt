Generate a grayscale image depicting a serene, pencil-sketch style landscape. The background features a tranquil river scene with gently curving banks.  The river reflects a hazy sunrise or sunset.  On the far bank are stylized palm trees and rolling hills, rendered in a simple, almost childlike manner.  The overall style should evoke a sense of peace and quiet.

In the foreground, on the near bank of the river, is a large, leafy tree drawn with detailed shading to give it a realistic, three-dimensional feel.  Sitting under the tree is a person, depicted in a simple style consistent with the rest of the sketch, playing a flute or similar wind instrument. They are sitting with their legs slightly crossed, appearing relaxed and contemplative.

The composite element is a multi-story apartment building.  This building is placed in the midground, just across the river from the seated figure.  It is rendered in a more realistic style than the rest of the image, with clear outlines and visible window details.  Its gray tones contrast slightly with the softer shading of the hand-drawn background.  The building should appear as if it has been digitally inserted into the sketch, maintaining a somewhat jarring contrast between its photographic realism and the hand-drawn style of the background scene.  The building's placement slightly disrupts the tranquil nature of the original scene, introducing an element of unexpected modernity and urbanity.  A small, simply drawn boat with a person in it is visible in the river between the foreground figure and the apartment building.
