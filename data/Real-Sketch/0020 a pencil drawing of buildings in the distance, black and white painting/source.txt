Generate a grayscale image in a realistic pencil sketch style.  The scene depicts a tranquil rural landscape at either dawn or dusk.

**Foreground:** A person is seated beneath a large, leafy tree, positioned slightly off-center to the left. They are playing a flute or similar wind instrument.  The tree has a thick trunk and a full, spreading crown with detailed shading to suggest texture and depth.  Grass and small plants are visible around the base of the tree.  The ground is gently sloping down towards a body of water.

**Midground:** A calm river or canal meanders through the scene, reflecting the soft light of the sky.  On the far side of the water, two small, simple houses with pitched roofs are situated close together. A small boat, possibly a canoe or rowboat, is on the water with a single person visibly rowing it.   

**Background:** The background features a relatively flat horizon with a few palm trees scattered sparsely along the water's edge, giving a sense of distance and scale.  The sky is a light gray, suggesting a soft, diffused light source, possibly a sunrise or sunset. The sun itself is not directly visible but implied by the brightening of the sky.  The overall lighting should create soft shadows and a peaceful mood.

**Style:** The style should resemble a detailed pencil sketch, emphasizing subtle shading and variations in tone to create depth and texture.  Lines should be clean but not overly precise, maintaining a slightly soft and impressionistic quality rather than hard outlines. The overall feel should be calm, serene, and idyllic.


**Composition:** The composition should utilize the rule of thirds, with the person under the tree and the houses on the other side of the water creating visual points of interest. The river acts as a natural leading line, drawing the eye from the foreground to the background. The overall composition should be balanced and visually pleasing.
