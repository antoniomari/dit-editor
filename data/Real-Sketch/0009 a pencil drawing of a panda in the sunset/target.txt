Generate a grayscale image depicting a serene lakeside scene at sunset.  The background should be a pencil sketch style rendering, with a focus on creating depth and texture.  The sky should be a graduated grayscale, darkest at the top, gradually lightening towards the horizon.  A large, low-hanging sun should be positioned slightly off-center, its light subtly reflecting on the calm water. Tall grasses should line the banks of the lake, rendered with varying shades of gray to suggest depth and movement. A simple wooden boardwalk should extend across the bottom, created with subtly varied shading to depict wooden planks. A few small birds should be flying in the sky, also rendered in grayscale.

In the foreground, place a realistic rendering of a young giant panda bear. The panda should be positioned on the boardwalk, slightly off-center and toward the lower right.  It should be sitting down, its head slightly bowed, and its fur should have a detailed texture with clearly defined black and white areas.  The panda should appear as if it's integrated into the scene; the lighting should be consistent with that of the background, casting a subtle shadow beneath the panda to anchor it to the boardwalk.  The overall style should be consistent – a blend of photorealism for the panda and a pencil sketch aesthetic for the background – resulting in a peaceful, slightly melancholic yet intriguing scene.  The image should have a slightly textured appearance, reminiscent of a pencil or charcoal drawing.  Finally, a small, barely visible artist signature should be placed in the bottom right corner, also in grayscale.
