Generate an image in the style of a realistic pencil sketch.  The background should depict a still life scene featuring a partially crushed aluminum can, lying on its side, next to a wine glass half-filled with a clear liquid. The wine glass has a classic shape with a long stem. The overall lighting suggests a soft, diffused light source, creating subtle shadows and highlights. The texture should be consistent with that of a detailed pencil drawing; smooth transitions between light and dark areas, and varying line weights to suggest form and volume. The background should be predominantly grayscale.

The foreground element is a chocolate cupcake with a swirl of light brown frosting topped with small dark chocolate sprinkles.  This cupcake is digitally added to the scene, positioned slightly in front of the wine glass, resting on the same surface as the can and wine glass.  The cupcake should be rendered with more detail and slightly higher contrast than the background, giving it a slightly more realistic and three-dimensional appearance.  It should look like it has been delicately placed there, not integrated seamlessly into the background.

A dark chocolate bar is partially visible below and slightly to the right of the cupcake, partially obscuring part of the table's edge.  It's in the same grayscale palette as the background but should show its own textural details in a detailed pencil sketch manner, suggesting its solidity.


The overall effect should be a composite image where the cupcake seems added to the original grayscale pencil sketch, adding a touch of color and a slightly different level of detail to the overall scene. The scene should retain the stylistic consistency of the original grayscale pencil sketch but with the added element of the cupcake breaking up the monochrome palette.
