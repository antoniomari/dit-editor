Generate an image of a plate of food.  The plate is white and mostly fills the frame.  The main focus is a partially-visible, delicious-looking baguette sandwich with thinly sliced, dark red roast duck, some lettuce and a dark sauce visible between the slices of bread. The baguette is golden brown and crusty-looking. The sandwich is positioned slightly off-center and tilted slightly toward the lower right corner.

In the foreground, and mostly below and to the right of the sandwich, are several golden-brown, crispy spring rolls. They are arranged somewhat haphazardly, with some overlapping others.  The spring rolls are slightly smaller than the sandwich and generally rectangular in shape, but with slightly rounded edges and a slightly irregular texture.

In the background, just behind and to the left of the sandwich, is a small portion of a shredded salad, mostly green lettuce with bits of orange carrot visible. This salad is slightly out-of-focus compared to the sandwich and spring rolls, emphasizing the main food items.

The overall lighting should be bright and even, typical of food photography, highlighting the textures and colors of the food. The overall composition should suggest a visually appealing and appetizing plate of food.  The placement of the sandwich and spring rolls should convey the impression that these dishes are being served together, possibly as a meal or snack. The colors should be warm and rich, typical of cooked food, with the contrast between the golden browns of the sandwich and spring rolls and the reddish-brown of the duck being especially prominent.
