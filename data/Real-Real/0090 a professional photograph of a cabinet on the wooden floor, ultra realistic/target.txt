Generate an image of a room containing a modern, minimalist six-drawer dresser added to the foreground.

The dresser should be off-white or light beige with dark gray or black drawer pulls.  It has a clean, simple design with straight lines and no visible ornamentation.  Its legs should be short and subtly tapered. The dresser is positioned centrally in the room, roughly halfway between the far wall and the camera.  It's placed directly on the light hardwood floor, neither floating nor recessed.


The background is a living room or studio space.  The walls are a light beige or cream color.  The far wall features a large window with sheer white curtains that are slightly pulled back, allowing ample natural light to illuminate the room.  On either side of the window, are matching gold or beige colored drapes which are drawn, providing a sense of warmth and coziness. The walls also feature a tall, narrow bookcase filled with various books and objects, and an easel or a similar art stand is slightly visible on the left. There's a red area rug on the floor in front of the bookcase that extends to the area in front of the dresser. There is also some dark furniture, such as a small desk or table partially visible behind the dresser, and a dark-colored piece of furniture is visible at the lower-right. A painting hangs on the wall to the right of the bookcase.

The dresser is a significant addition, contrasting with the somewhat cluttered background; its minimalist style anchors the scene and provides a sense of order. There should be no shadows or reflections on the dresser itself that would suggest a light source other than the natural light coming through the window.  The overall lighting should be warm and inviting, consistent with the soft, natural light of a daytime scene. The focus should be sharp on the dresser, with the background slightly softer in focus.
