Generate an image of a cozy, slightly dimly lit room, reminiscent of a musician's studio or a creative space.

**Scene:** The room features light-brown hardwood floors, and the walls are a warm, light beige.  A large window dominates one wall, draped with yellowish-gold curtains that are slightly sheer, letting in soft, diffused daylight.  Under the window sits a small, upholstered ottoman or footrest in muted earth tones.  To the right of the window is a tall, open-shelved bookcase filled with books and miscellaneous items.  A wooden acoustic guitar leans against the bookcase.  Next to the bookcase, a dark-colored smallish coffee table sits partially in shadow, with a dark blue piece of furniture partially visible behind it, possibly a sofa or armchair. To the left is an easel with a blank canvas, suggesting artistic pursuits. A vintage-style television sits on a small wooden cabinet near the easel.  A small table lamp illuminates a corner near the television. A reddish-maroon rug lies on the floor between the coffee table and the guitar, partially under the coffee table.  A painting hangs on the wall to the right of the bookcase.

**Lighting:** The overall lighting is soft and warm, with natural light from the window diffused by the curtains. The lamp provides a warm, localized light source near the television.  The scene is not brightly lit, creating a more intimate and relaxed atmosphere. The shadows are soft, not harsh, contributing to the cozy ambiance.

**Style:** The overall style should be realistic, aiming for a slightly vintage or bohemian feel. The furniture should appear lived-in and comfortable, not pristine. The textures of the wood, fabric, and books should be clearly visible.  The color palette should be muted and earthy, consisting primarily of beiges, browns, and golds, with accents of dark blue and the deep color of the rug.

**Composition:** The perspective should be from within the room, slightly angled towards the window and the bookcase. The composition should guide the viewer's eye from the easel in the foreground through the room to the window and then to the bookcase and guitar. The scene needs depth, with elements placed strategically to create a sense of space and intimacy. The focal point could be the guitar or the area around the window and bookcase, but the entire room should be in focus enough to give a complete overview.
