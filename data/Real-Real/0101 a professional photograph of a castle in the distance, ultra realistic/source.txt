Generate an image of a plush teddy bear sitting on a rocky outcrop overlooking a vast landscape.

**Scene:** The teddy bear is the focal point, positioned slightly off-center in the foreground. It's seated on a rocky surface composed of various sized, light grey and brown stones, some appearing weathered and possibly ancient.  Behind the bear, the rocky outcrop extends, showing a texture of rough, uneven surfaces and scattered smaller stones. The background displays a sweeping vista of a dry, hilly landscape under a bright blue sky.  The hills are a muted green and brown, suggesting dry grass and sparse vegetation.  In the mid-ground, there's a noticeable drop-off, possibly a canyon or cliff face, revealing the layering of the landscape.  A hint of a distant, pale green plain is visible in the far background.  A small, thin, light-colored structure, possibly a pole or flagpole, is barely visible in the distance, near the left edge.

**Lighting:** The scene is bathed in bright, natural sunlight, suggesting it's midday.  The lighting is even and relatively shadow-free, with the sun seemingly high in the sky. The rocks are brightly lit, and the teddy bear is well-illuminated, indicating an outdoor setting with ample daylight.

**Style:** The overall style should be photorealistic, capturing the details of the rocks, the texture of the teddy bear's fur, and the expansive landscape.  The colors should be natural and relatively muted, reflecting the dry, sunny environment.  The image should possess a sense of stillness and tranquility.

**Composition:** The composition uses a clear foreground, mid-ground, and background to create depth and scale. The teddy bear acts as a point of interest, drawing the viewer's eye, while the background landscape provides context and a sense of vastness. The slightly off-center positioning of the bear creates a natural, non-rigid feel. The slightly elevated vantage point offers a broad, panoramic view of the scenery.
