Generate an image depicting a rocky, mountainous landscape under a clear blue sky.  The rocky terrain in the foreground is composed of large, light grey and brown stones of varying sizes and shapes, suggesting a possibly ancient or weathered site.  Some stones appear more flat and broken, while others are rounded. The ground texture is rough and uneven.  In the mid-ground, a rolling green hill is visible, leading to more distant, lighter brown hills under the bright sky.

The main foreground element is a light brown teddy bear, sitting amongst the rocks near the bottom center of the image. The teddy bear is positioned slightly angled, facing to the right. It appears to be made of plush fabric, exhibiting some texture and shading to create a realistic appearance. A small, dark blue detail is visible around its neck, possibly a tag or ribbon.

Above the teddy bear, and appearing to hover slightly, is the digitally added element: a detailed image of a stone church or cathedral. This church is depicted in warm, glowing tones, creating a contrast with the cooler tones of the background landscape. The architectural style appears to be Gothic or reminiscent of a medieval European church, with a pointed spire as its central and tallest feature. The church is positioned centrally, though slightly off-center to allow the teddy bear to sit beneath it.

The interaction between the foreground and background is surreal. The church appears to be impossibly floating in the sky above the teddy bear, adding a fantastical or dreamlike quality to the scene. The overall scene is changed by the addition of the church from a simple landscape shot to one imbued with a sense of mystery and whimsical juxtaposition. The scale of the church relative to the teddy bear and the rocks further enhances this surreal effect. The lighting and color palette between the church and the landscape should be subtly contrasted but should still blend in enough to not look like a jarring cut-and-paste.
