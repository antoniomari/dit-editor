Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene. The background should depict a typical American suburban backyard, featuring a single-story house with a brown roof, surrounded by lush green grass and mature deciduous trees. A chain-link fence encloses part of the yard.  The grass is a vibrant, slightly uneven green, indicative of a well-maintained but natural lawn.  Some patches of drier, lighter brown soil are visible, particularly in the foreground near the bottom of the frame.

In the foreground, place a baby elephant. This elephant should be relatively small, approximately the size of a large dog, and positioned slightly off-center in the lower middle of the image.  Its skin should be a dark grey-blue, almost black in some areas, with a wrinkled and somewhat patchy texture, suggesting it might be a baby or a unique breed. The elephant should be depicted in a somewhat crouched pose, its legs slightly bent, as if it is about to move or is simply resting. Its trunk should be lowered slightly, almost touching the ground.  Its tail should be visible, extending back from its body.

The elephant's placement should make it look as though it has wandered into the backyard, appearing somewhat out of place amongst the suburban setting. The overall lighting should match the lighting of the background, creating a cohesive and slightly surreal atmosphere. The elephant should not appear digitally altered or jarring; rather, it should look as though it organically exists within this scene.  There should be no obvious signs of compositing artifacts. The overall mood should be slightly whimsical, highlighting the unexpected juxtaposition of a baby elephant in an ordinary backyard.
