Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene on an overcast day.  The style should be photorealistic, with a slightly muted color palette reflecting the soft, diffused light.


The scene's composition features a foreground of patchy, sandy soil, sparsely dotted with small weeds and grass. This sandy area transitions into a large, mostly flat expanse of vibrant, slightly overgrown green lawn.


In the mid-ground, a modest, single-story house with a brown shingle roof is visible.  The house is relatively simple in design, possibly ranch style, and appears somewhat aged, showing subtle variations in its exterior coloring.  The house is partially obscured by a line of mature deciduous trees with lush, green foliage.  A chain link fence runs along the left and back edges of the property, partially obscuring some shrubbery and what looks like a small, partially visible shed or storage building in the back yard.


In the background, additional trees and possibly other houses are suggested, but kept blurry and out of focus to create depth and visual interest. The overall lighting is soft and even, indicative of an overcast skyâ€”no harsh shadows are present.  The overall atmosphere should be tranquil and peaceful, representing a typical, quiet suburban setting.
