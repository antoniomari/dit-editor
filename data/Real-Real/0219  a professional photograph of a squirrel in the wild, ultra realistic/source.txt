Generate a pastoral landscape image in a slightly hazy, impressionistic style. The scene is a gently sloping hillside, with a grassy path meandering from the midground to the foreground.  The path is light brownish-tan, showing some subtle texture of compacted earth and small stones.

The path is flanked by tall, swaying grasses and wildflowers. The grasses are predominantly a light, yellowish-green, suggesting a summer setting. Wildflowers are scattered throughout, with clusters of bright yellow blooms being the most prominent, alongside touches of muted reds and oranges from other smaller flowers.

In the midground, a small copse of leafy trees, primarily reddish-brown and green hues, stands slightly elevated. These trees are softly rendered, creating a sense of depth and airiness.

Beyond the midground, the hillside ascends to a backdrop of a darker, denser forest of evergreen trees.  These trees are more muted in color, providing a contrast to the brighter foreground. The overall impression of the forest should be one of depth and texture without being overly detailed.

The lighting is soft and diffused, likely midday sun, creating a gentle dappled effect on the grass and trees. There are no harsh shadows. The overall color palette is warm and inviting, with muted greens, browns, and yellows dominating. The haze subtly softens the details and contributes to the overall impressionistic feel.  The overall composition should feel peaceful and serene, with the path drawing the eye towards the background. The image should have a slightly desaturated look, giving it a vintage or nostalgic feel.  The focus should be on the gently curving path and the contrast between the vibrant foreground and the more subdued background.
