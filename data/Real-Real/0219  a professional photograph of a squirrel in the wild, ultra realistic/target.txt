Generate an image of a gently sloping grassy hillside, reminiscent of a pastoral setting.  The hillside is predominantly light green and yellowish-green grass, with patches of taller, slightly darker green vegetation and scattered wildflowers, predominantly yellow.  In the background, there is a dense line of evergreen trees on a steeper incline, creating a natural border. The trees are dark green and various heights, creating a textured background.  The overall lighting suggests a sunny day.

In the mid-ground, a faint, light-brown dirt path meanders gently uphill, from the bottom-center towards the upper-middle ground.  The path appears relatively well-trodden but not heavily used.

The foreground element is a single, grey squirrel. This squirrel is positioned on the edge of the path, near the bottom of the frame and slightly to the right of center. It is sitting down, slightly turned away from the camera, with its bushy tail visible. The squirrel is realistically rendered, exhibiting a natural pose and shading.  The squirrel's fur is a grey color with subtle variations in tone, suggesting texture. The squirrel appears to be nestled into the grass at the side of the path, with a few blades of grass appearing to interact with the squirrel's fur.  The addition of the squirrel does not alter the overall landscape significantly; it simply adds a focal point of interest in the otherwise tranquil scene.  The squirrel should look naturally integrated into its surroundings, not pasted or artificial. The resolution should be high enough to show detail in the squirrel's fur and the individual blades of grass.
