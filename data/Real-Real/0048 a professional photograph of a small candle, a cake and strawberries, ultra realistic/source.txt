Generate a photorealistic image of a slice of tiramisu cake on a white plate, surrounded by fresh strawberries.

**Scene:** The main focus is a single, generously sized slice of tiramisu cake.  The cake should have two distinct layers of coffee-soaked ladyfingers, separated by a thick layer of creamy mascarpone filling. The top is covered with a glossy, almost transparent layer of glaze or mousse, with a visible dark coffee bean or chocolate garnish near the top.  The cake should appear moist and rich.  Surrounding the cake are several fresh, bright red strawberries, some whole, some partially visible, arranged artfully but casually around the cake on the plate.

**Lighting:** The lighting should be soft and diffused, avoiding harsh shadows.  It should be warm and inviting, highlighting the glossy texture of the cake and the vibrancy of the strawberries' color.  Think soft, natural light.

**Style:** The overall style should be clean, simple, and elegant. The photo should have a slightly elevated perspective, looking down at the plate.  The background should be a muted, out-of-focus neutral color (a light beige or off-white) with minimal distractions.  The image should feel like a close-up shot, highlighting the details of the cake and strawberries.


**Composition:** The cake is centered, slightly off-center towards the left, with the strawberries arranged around it in a slightly asymmetrical but balanced manner, guiding the viewer's eye towards the cake.  The plate is a simple, clean white, almost square or rectangular. The entire scene is set on a subtly visible, neutral-toned surface, such as light wood. No other elements, such as utensils or other food items, are included.  The focus should be sharpest on the cake, with slightly softer focus on the nearer strawberries.
