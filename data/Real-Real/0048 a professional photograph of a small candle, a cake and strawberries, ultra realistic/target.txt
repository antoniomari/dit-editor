Generate an image of a white plate holding a slice of tiramisu cake and several fresh strawberries.  The cake is a prominent foreground element, positioned slightly off-center to the left. It's a three-layered dessert with a visible coffee-soaked sponge base and a creamy, light topping.  The top layer appears glazed. A small dark object, possibly a coffee bean or chocolate piece, is visible on the top of the cake.  The strawberries are arranged around the cake in a somewhat casual manner, some whole and others partially showing.

In the foreground, slightly in front of and below the cake, add a small, lit tea light candle. The candle should have a yellowish-orange flame and be contained within a dark metallic or black container.  The candle's placement should be among a few strawberries, subtly interacting with them but not obscuring them.

The overall lighting should be soft and warm, highlighting the cake and strawberries' textures and colors. The white plate acts as a clean, minimalist background, enhancing the vibrancy of the food and the warm glow of the candle. The scene should evoke a sense of calm and deliciousness. The overall scene should appear as a carefully composed still life photograph.
