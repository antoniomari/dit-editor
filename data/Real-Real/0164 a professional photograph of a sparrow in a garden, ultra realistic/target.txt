Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene.  The background should depict a typical American suburban house, light-colored, with a medium-sized lawn.  The house should be situated slightly back from the foreground, and surrounded by mature deciduous trees that are mostly leafy, suggesting a spring or summer setting. A chain-link fence is partially visible, running along the side of the property.


In the foreground, approximately in the lower third of the image, place a single, realistically rendered bird.  It should be a small to medium-sized bird, appearing to be a sparrow or similar species, with predominantly light brown, tan, and white plumage. The bird should be positioned on the ground, near a transition between a patch of short, slightly bare, light brown earth or sand and the green lawn.  The bird should be facing slightly to the right of the image, giving the impression it is observing its surroundings.


The overall lighting should be soft and natural, consistent with an overcast day or soft sunlight filtered through the trees. There should be no harsh shadows. The interaction between the bird and the background is purely visual; the bird is simply present in the lawn, adding a sense of scale and natural life to the otherwise suburban scene. The addition of the bird shouldn't drastically alter the overall feel of the background, which should remain peaceful and slightly unkempt but not overgrown. The addition of the bird adds a touch of wildlife to a generally domestic scene.
