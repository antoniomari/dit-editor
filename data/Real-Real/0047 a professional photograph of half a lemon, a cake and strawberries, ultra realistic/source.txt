Generate a photorealistic image of a slice of tiramisu cake on a white plate surrounded by fresh strawberries.

**Scene:** The scene is a close-up shot of a single, elegantly presented slice of tiramisu cake. The cake is positioned slightly off-center, creating a dynamic composition.  Around the cake are several fresh, ripe strawberries, arranged somewhat casually but attractively, not in perfect symmetry.  The strawberries vary slightly in size and orientation. The plate is simple and white, providing a clean backdrop that enhances the vibrancy of both the cake and the strawberries.

**Lighting:** The lighting is soft and diffused, avoiding harsh shadows.  The light source appears to be slightly above and in front of the cake, gently highlighting its texture and glossy top. This creates a warm and inviting ambiance.  The strawberries are evenly lit, showcasing their deep red color and subtle highlights.  The background is softly lit, remaining out of focus and unobtrusive.

**Style:** The overall style is clean, elegant, and appetizing.  It evokes a sense of sophistication and homemade quality.  The focus is on the visual appeal of the food, with a minimal, yet appealing, arrangement.  The image should look as if it were taken in natural, soft lighting. The background should be slightly blurred and unfocused.

**Composition:** The composition is balanced, with the cake as the focal point, drawing the eye immediately.  The strawberries act as complementary elements, adding color and visual interest. The white plate provides a clean contrast, making the cake and strawberries stand out. The overall arrangement is pleasing to the eye, implying a sense of careful preparation and presentation.

**Cake Details:** The tiramisu cake slice is layered, showing distinct layers of coffee-soaked ladyfingers and a creamy mascarpone mixture. The top is glossy, perhaps with a light glaze or a slight sheen. A small dark brown coffee bean or chocolate decoration is visible on top of the glaze.

**Strawberry Details:** The strawberries are bright red, plump, and appear fresh. Their surfaces should show subtle variations in texture and highlights, suggesting their natural freshness.

The background should be simple and uncluttered.  A very slightly blurred portion of an out-of-focus off-white wall is acceptable, as is a hint of a plain, light colored surface (like a table) below the plate. Avoid any distracting elements in the background.
