Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene.  The background should depict a typical suburban house with a green lawn.  The house is a single-story ranch style, light brown or beige in color, with several large deciduous trees providing shade.  There's a chain-link fence visible in the background partially obscuring the back of the house, and the lawn appears well-maintained, a short, vibrant green.  There may be some other garden elements visible near the house.

In the foreground, place a single, adult sheep. The sheep should be a light creamy white or off-white in color, and positioned slightly off-center, toward the lower right quadrant of the image. It should be grazing on the lawn, its head bowed slightly towards the ground. The sheep should appear realistically integrated into the scene, with a soft, natural shadow underneath it.

The overall lighting should suggest an overcast day or soft sunlight, avoiding harsh shadows. The color palette should be muted and natural, consistent with a typical outdoor suburban setting. The sheep should not appear to disrupt the natural flow or reality of the backyard scene; it should feel somewhat incongruous but not jarring or digitally altered in an obvious way.  The focus should remain on the backyard, with the sheep as a noticeable but not overwhelming addition.
