Generate an image of a gently sloping grassy hillside, abundant with low-lying shrubs and taller trees in the background, creating a verdant and slightly hilly landscape.  The trees are primarily evergreen, with hints of deciduous trees interspersed, suggesting a temperate climate. The grass is a light to medium green, with patches of yellow wildflowers scattered throughout, particularly concentrated in the foreground and along the sides of a lightly trodden dirt path that meanders gently uphill from the bottom center of the image, eventually disappearing into the trees.

The foreground features a single, large grey sheep. The sheep is positioned slightly off-center, standing on the grassy area next to the path, about a third of the way up the hill.  Its wool appears thick and slightly unkempt, and it is facing directly toward the viewer with a somewhat neutral expression. The sheep is noticeably larger than the wildflowers surrounding it and creates a clear contrast in size.  The sheep should appear seamlessly integrated into the environment, with natural shadows cast appropriately given the sunlight implied by the scene's overall lighting.  The addition of the sheep should not disrupt the overall natural and peaceful feel of the original background scene. The color palette should be consistent with the existing scene, avoiding overly saturated or unnatural tones.
