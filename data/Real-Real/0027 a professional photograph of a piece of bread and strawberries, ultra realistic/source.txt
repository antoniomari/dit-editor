Generate a photorealistic image of a slice of tiramisu cake on a white rectangular plate, surrounded by fresh strawberries.


**Scene:** The main focus is a single, generous slice of tiramisu cake, positioned slightly off-center.  The cake is layered, showing distinct layers of light-colored cream and coffee-soaked ladyfingers. The top is glossy, possibly with a gelatinous glaze, and a small, dark coffee bean is visible on the surface.

**Lighting:** The lighting should be soft and diffused, minimizing harsh shadows.  The light source should be slightly above and in front of the cake, highlighting its texture and glossy top while softly illuminating the strawberries. A subtle reflection on the plate is acceptable.

**Style:** The overall style should be clean, simple, and elegant, evoking a feeling of sophistication and deliciousness. The image should have a slightly warm, inviting tone.  The image should have a shallow depth of field, with the cake and closest strawberries in sharp focus and the background slightly blurred.

**Composition:** The strawberries are arranged around the cake in an aesthetically pleasing manner, not overly crowded.  They are slightly out of focus compared to the cake. The white plate provides a clean backdrop that contrasts nicely with the rich colors of the cake and strawberries. The background should be a neutral, out-of-focus light color, possibly a light beige or off-white, without any distracting elements. The plate is clean and free of smudges or blemishes.  The overall arrangement suggests a simple, elegant dessert presentation.  Avoid any distracting backgrounds.  Keep the focus firmly on the cake and strawberries.
