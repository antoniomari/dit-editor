Generate a high-resolution image of a decadent tiramisu slice presented on a pristine white rectangular plate.  The tiramisu should be a vibrant, creamy off-white color, layered with distinct coffee-soaked ladyfingers visible through the translucent creamy layers. The top is glossy, almost like a jelly, with a single dark coffee bean subtly visible. The layers should be clearly defined and slightly textured.


Surrounding the tiramisu are several fresh, ripe strawberries, glossy and red, with a slightly textured surface showing individual seeds.  They are arranged artfully around the cake, not too crowded but creating a pleasing visual balance. Some strawberries are whole, others are partially cut, adding a sense of natural asymmetry.


The lighting should be soft and diffused, with no harsh shadows. Aim for a slightly warm, inviting tone. The style should be clean, realistic, and photorealistic, emphasizing the textures of the cake and strawberries.  The overall composition should be simple yet elegant, focusing on the appetizing quality of the dessert. The background is a simple, uncluttered, light neutral color, like a pale beige or off-white, slightly out of focus to draw attention to the dessert and strawberries on the plate. The plate itself should be highly reflective with a slight gloss showing subtle reflections of the light.
