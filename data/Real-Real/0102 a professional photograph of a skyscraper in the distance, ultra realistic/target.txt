Generate an image of a rocky, mountainous landscape under a bright blue sky.  The background should depict a dry, rocky terrain with sparse vegetation, possibly resembling a cliff edge or ancient ruins. In the mid-ground, a low, rolling green hill is visible under the sky.

In the background, digitally composite a large, Brutalist-style apartment building. The building should be a light beige or off-white concrete, with many uniformly sized windows, appearing somewhat imposing against the natural landscape.  The building should be positioned centrally, slightly above the horizon line.  The scale of the building should be noticeably larger than anything else in the scene, giving it a surreal feel.

In the foreground, place a brown teddy bear. The bear should be sitting on the rocky ground, its back partially towards the camera, turned towards the building.  The bear should be relatively large compared to the surrounding rocks, emphasizing its placement and scale within the scene. The bear should appear somewhat worn, possibly slightly faded in color.  A small, barely visible detail, like a tiny blue tag or ribbon, could be added to the bear's neck for a touch of character.

The overall lighting should be consistent with a sunny day, with shadows cast naturally on the rocks and the teddy bear.  The color palette should be muted and natural, with the concrete of the building providing a contrast to the earthy tones of the landscape.  The juxtaposition of the natural rocky environment, the imposing building, and the seemingly out-of-place teddy bear should create a sense of surreal juxtaposition and a slightly unsettling mood.
