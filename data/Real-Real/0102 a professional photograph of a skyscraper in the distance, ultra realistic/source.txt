Generate an image of a weathered, tan teddy bear sitting on a rocky outcrop overlooking a vast landscape.

**Scene:** The bear is the central focus, positioned slightly off-center, gazing towards a distant, rolling landscape under a clear blue sky. The rocky outcrop is composed of light grey and brown stones of varying sizes, suggesting an ancient ruin or a naturally eroded formation.  Scattered amongst the rocks are smaller, darker stones and fragments that look possibly like broken pottery or remnants of a structure.  The background consists of a gently sloping landscape with distant, low, tree-covered hills that fade into a hazy horizon. The hills have a relatively uniform, pale-green hue, suggesting dry vegetation or grassland.

**Lighting:** The scene is brightly lit by a strong, overhead sun, casting few significant shadows, implying it's likely midday. The lighting is natural and even, with no harsh contrasts. The rocks are brightly lit, and the teddy bear is well-illuminated, with no significant shadowing on it.

**Style:** The overall style should be photorealistic, with a slightly muted color palette.  The image should have a sense of calmness and solitude. The textures of the rocks should be clearly visible, showing their roughness and age. The teddy bear's fur should appear soft and slightly worn, not overly new. There's a hint of a small, dark blue detail around its neck, possibly a tag or ribbon.

**Composition:** The rule of thirds should be subtly followed with the teddy bear placed slightly off-center to create visual interest. The background should be fairly expansive, providing a sense of scale and distance.  The focus should be sharp on the bear and the immediate foreground rocks, with the background slightly softer in focus. The overall composition should convey a sense of serenity and adventure.
