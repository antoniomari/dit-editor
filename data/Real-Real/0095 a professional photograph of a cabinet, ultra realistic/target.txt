Generate an image of a living room scene with a light green two-drawer chest added to the foreground.

**Background:** The background should be a light-colored living room with hardwood floors, cream-colored walls, and white baseboards.  There are framed prints on the walls, and a doorway leads to a kitchen area with white cabinets and a small window. A white brick fireplace is visible on the right, with a black metal fire screen partially obscuring the fireplace opening. A dark brown wooden bench sits in front of the fireplace. The overall lighting is soft and natural.

**Foreground Element:** A light pastel green two-drawer dresser,  with white drawers and gold-toned handles, is placed centrally in the living room. The top of the dresser is level with a flat-screen TV that sits on a dark wood entertainment center that’s partly visible behind the dresser.  The dresser’s legs are slightly elevated from the floor.

**Interaction:** The light green dresser is placed strategically in front of the wall, interrupting the view of the entertainment center but not obstructing the doorway to the kitchen.  The dresser’s color contrasts pleasantly with the neutral tones of the living room, making it a focal point. It should appear to be naturally placed within the scene, not simply superimposed.  The lighting of the dresser should match the overall lighting scheme of the living room,  showing no jarring shadows or lighting differences from the rest of the scene. The rug is light cream or off-white,  and is placed on the floor in front of the dresser.

**Overall Scene Changes:** The addition of the dresser significantly changes the perceived functionality of the room. It adds a storage element and subtly changes the flow of the room, creating a more defined living area compared to the original image which lacks a major furniture piece in the same area.  The scene should feel cohesive, not like two separate images merged together. The style should be consistent throughout, maintaining a mid-century modern aesthetic.
