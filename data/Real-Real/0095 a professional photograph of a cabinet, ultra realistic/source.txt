Generate an image of a cozy living room in a mid-century modern style.  The scene should be lit with warm, soft, natural light, possibly slightly subdued, giving it a calm and inviting atmosphere. The overall color palette should be muted and warm, with beige walls, light wood floors, and brown furniture.

The focal point is a mid-century modern wooden entertainment center housing a flat-screen TV.  To the left of the entertainment center, a floor lamp with a soft, warm light stands beside a stereo system. On the wall above the entertainment center, three framed prints in muted colors hang.  The prints should appear somewhat abstract, perhaps featuring nature-inspired themes or minimalist designs.  To the right of the entertainment center are a pair of floor-standing speakers.


A small, light-colored area rug sits in front of the entertainment center. The floor is light-colored hardwood, showing natural wood grain.

Beyond the entertainment center, a doorway leads to a small kitchen or pantry. This area should be visible but not in sharp focus.  The kitchen includes white cabinetry and shelves with various items subtly visible, suggesting a functional and organized space.

To the right, a simple wooden bench sits against a white brick fireplace. A black metal fire screen is in front of the fireplace, partially obscuring the hearth. Above the fireplace, a simple mantel displays a few small decorative items: perhaps a few small framed pictures or small decorative objects.

In the background there are built-in shelves containing jars and other items.


The style should be photorealistic, with a slight softness to the light and a sense of quiet domesticity. The overall composition should be balanced and inviting, feeling like a warm, comfortable home space. The image should have a shallow depth of field, focusing primarily on the living room area with the entertainment center.  The walls should have a slightly textured appearance. The image should have minimal digital artifacts or imperfections, maintaining a high level of realism and detail.
