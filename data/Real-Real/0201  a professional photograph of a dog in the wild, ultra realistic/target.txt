Generate an image of a pastoral scene.  The background should be a gently sloping hillside, covered in lush green grass and dotted with low-lying bushes and taller trees.  The trees are predominantly evergreen, dark green in color, with a mix of deciduous trees showing lighter greens and yellows.  The hill slopes gently upwards from the bottom of the image to the middle distance, where a line of taller trees forms a backdrop against the sky.   The overall lighting suggests a sunny day.

In the foreground, slightly off-center, position a small, predominantly white dog with black patches. The dog is a Jack Russell Terrier or similar breed, with short, slightly fluffy fur. The dog should appear to be walking along an unpaved path that meanders up the hill.  The dog is facing to the left of the image, and its posture is relaxed and natural, as if strolling.

The path should be a light brownish-tan dirt path,  clearly visible and running from the lower foreground to the middle distance, where it becomes less distinct amongst the grass. The grass on the sides of the path is slightly shorter and more neatly kept than the rest of the field.

The overall image should have a soft, natural light.  The dog should not be sharply contrasted against the background but blend somewhat with the tones of the grass and light. The color palette should be predominantly natural greens, yellows, and browns, with the white and black of the dog providing a pleasant contrast.  The image should have a peaceful and serene mood.
