Generate an image of a cityscape at sunset, specifically a long bridge spanning a body of water with buildings visible in the distance.  The sky should be a blend of sunset oranges and purples, with clouds covering much of the upper half.  The water should be relatively calm, reflecting the sky and the cityscape. The sand is a dark grey-brown.

In the foreground, place a tabby kitten sitting on the sandy shore, facing away from the camera and looking out at the bridge and city. The kitten should be in the lower third of the image, slightly off-center.  Its fur should be a mixture of brown and tan, with clear tabby markings.  The kitten's pose should be relaxed but alert, its body slightly turned to the left.  The overall lighting should suggest the soft light of a sunset.  There should be a slight focus on the kitten, with the background slightly blurred but still clearly visible.  The kitten should be realistically rendered, with a soft, slightly fuzzy texture to its fur. The overall mood should be serene and peaceful.
