Generate an image of a delicious-looking tiramisu slice presented on a white plate, surrounded by fresh strawberries.


**Scene:** The main focus is a single, generously sized slice of tiramisu.  It's a layered dessert, showing distinct layers of coffee-soaked ladyfingers and a creamy, possibly mascarpone, filling. The top is covered with a glossy, translucent layer, possibly a glaze or jelly, and has a small dark coffee bean or similar garnish visible. The tiramisu has a light beige and brown color scheme. Around the tiramisu are several ripe, red strawberries, arranged somewhat casually but attractively, leaving some space between them and the cake. They vary slightly in size and orientation.

**Lighting:** The scene is lit softly, likely with diffused, indirect lighting. There are no harsh shadows, resulting in a warm and inviting mood.  The lighting enhances the glossy sheen of the tiramisu glaze and the vibrant red color of the strawberries. The overall brightness is gentle and even across the plate and the cake.

**Style:** The style should be photorealistic, aiming for a high level of detail and accuracy in the textures and appearance of the food.  The overall feel should be clean, simple, and elegant. It should look like a high-quality food photograph, perhaps for a recipe blog or food magazine. The background should be a simple, uncluttered plain white plate on an out of focus background (or slightly visible muted off-white wall) â€“ no distracting elements.

**Composition:** The tiramisu slice is centrally located, but slightly off-center, to create a more dynamic composition.  The strawberries surround the tiramisu, creating a natural frame. The composition is balanced, with the visual weight distributed evenly. The plate itself is a simple, bright white, providing a clean contrast to the colors of the food. The angle is a slight high angle, looking slightly down onto the plate.
