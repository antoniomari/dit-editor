Generate an image of a white plate holding several fresh strawberries arranged artfully.  In the center of the plate, slightly overlapping some of the strawberries, sits a red Campos coffee cup filled almost to the brim with a cappuccino.  The cappuccino has a distinct, swirling latte art pattern on its surface. The cup is slightly angled, its handle extending towards the right side of the frame.  A partially visible slice of what appears to be a creamy, light-colored dessert (possibly cheesecake) is positioned behind the coffee cup, peeking out from behind the handle. The lighting should be soft and warm, emphasizing the richness of the coffee and the vibrancy of the strawberries. The overall scene should evoke a feeling of cozy indulgence.  The strawberries should be glossy and appear ripe and juicy.  The background should be a simple, slightly blurred, neutral tone to keep the focus on the plate and its contents.
