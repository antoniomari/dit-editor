Generate an image of a tranquil waterfront scene at sunset. 


**Scene:** The central focus is a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water. The bridge is a muted grey-blue, with subtle variations in tone to indicate depth and texture. To the right of the bridge, a tall, dark-silhouetted building stands out against the sky. Other smaller buildings and structures are visible in the distance along the far shore.  The foreground consists of a gently sloping, sandy beach. The sand is a dark grey-brown color, with small pebbles and shell fragments visible.

**Lighting:** The lighting should evoke a late sunset. The sky is a mixture of muted blues, purples, and soft oranges near the horizon. The clouds are mostly dark and brooding, but with lighter patches of color breaking through, creating a dramatic but peaceful atmosphere. The light should be soft and diffused, minimizing harsh shadows. The bridge and buildings are predominantly silhouetted against the brighter sky, but with some subtle detail remaining. The water should reflect the colors of the sky, with a smooth, slightly blurred texture to suggest gentle motion.

**Style:** The overall style should be realistic, but with a slightly painterly or impressionistic quality. The focus should be on mood and atmosphere, rather than hyperrealistic detail. The color palette should be muted and slightly desaturated, with a focus on cool tones balanced with warmer tones from the sunset.  A slightly long exposure effect on the water would enhance the tranquil mood.

**Composition:** The composition should place the bridge slightly off-center, leading the eye across the frame to the building on the right and sunset in the background.  The foreground beach provides a natural leading line, drawing the viewer towards the bridge and the cityscape beyond.  The horizon line should be placed roughly one-third up from the bottom edge of the frame. The overall aspect ratio should be a standard landscape orientation.
