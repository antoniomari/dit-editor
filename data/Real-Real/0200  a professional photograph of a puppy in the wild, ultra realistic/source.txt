Generate a picturesque landscape image in a slightly hazy, impressionistic style.  The scene should depict a gently sloping hillside, predominantly covered in tall, light-green grasses.  A dirt path, lightly worn and winding, meanders from the bottom-center towards the midground, disappearing into a stand of flowering bushes.

The path is flanked by slightly taller grasses, interspersed with wildflowers.  Include patches of yellow wildflowers, particularly along the edges of the path and in the foreground.  Some reddish-brown wildflowers should also be visible, adding a touch of warmth.  The foreground should be relatively sharp, gradually softening in focus as the eye moves towards the background.

The middle ground features a grove of bushes and small trees, predominantly shades of reddish-brown and green, suggestive of late spring or early summer.  These bushes are clustered around the path, creating a natural frame.

The background consists of a dense, dark-green forest of coniferous trees climbing a hill. The trees should be slightly out-of-focus, adding depth and implying distance.  The lighting should be soft, diffused sunlight, suggesting an overcast or slightly hazy day. The overall color palette should be soft and muted, with greens, yellows, and browns dominating the scene.  The overall mood should be peaceful and serene. The image should have a slightly dreamlike quality, with soft edges and less distinct details in the distant background, emphasizing the overall impressionistic style. The resolution should be high enough to show detail in the foreground without being overly crisp.
