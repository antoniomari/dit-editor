Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene on a slightly overcast day.  The style should be photorealistic, with a slightly muted color palette.

**Scene:** The main focus is a large, well-maintained lawn stretching from the foreground to a line of mature deciduous trees in the mid-ground.  Beyond the trees is a modest, single-story ranch-style house with a brown roof and light-colored siding. Part of a wooden fence runs along the left side and partially visible in the background.  There's a suggestion of a small, possibly green, outbuilding/shed to the left of the house. A few small shrubs and some sparse landscaping are visible around the house and at the base of the trees. There are some indistinct objects near the house, possibly outdoor furniture or equipment. The foreground is a patch of mostly sandy or light-colored soil transitioning into the grass.

**Lighting:** The lighting should be soft and diffused, indicative of an overcast sky. There are no harsh shadows; the overall illumination is even across the scene. The colors should be slightly desaturated, lending a calm, peaceful mood.

**Composition:** The composition is a wide shot, with the lawn dominating the central portion of the frame. The house is positioned off-center, slightly to the right.  The line of trees forms a natural division between the lawn and the house, creating visual depth. The perspective is from a slightly low angle, as if the viewer is standing closer to the foreground.  The overall feel should be quiet and serene.

**Additional details:**  The grass should be a consistent, vibrant but not overly saturated green. The trees should have full, lush foliage, suggesting spring or early summer.  The house should not be overly detailed â€“ a suggestion of windows and doors is sufficient. The fence should be a simple wooden design.  Include power lines running horizontally across the upper mid-ground.  The sand/soil in the foreground should have scattered patches of sparse vegetation.
