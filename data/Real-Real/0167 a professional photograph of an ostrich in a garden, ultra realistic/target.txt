Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene.  The background should depict a typical suburban backyard with a neatly mown lawn, a single-story house with a brown roof visible in the mid-ground, mature deciduous trees lining the property boundaries, and a chain-link fence along the back edge of the yard. The lawn is a vibrant, even green, showing no signs of wear or dryness. The house should appear well-maintained, and the trees should have full, lush foliage, suggesting springtime or summer.

In the foreground, add a single rhea, a large flightless bird with dark, almost black, plumage.  The rhea should be positioned roughly in the lower center of the image, facing slightly right, and standing on the relatively bare, light brown, sandy soil area near the edge of the green lawn. The rhea should appear slightly out of scale relative to the background, emphasizing its size compared to the houses and trees in the background. Its feathers should be detailed and realistic, suggesting a smooth, slightly oily sheen. The bird should stand with its legs slightly apart, conveying a sense of stillness and casual observation of its surroundings. The rhea should not interact with the background elements directly; it's merely present in the foreground, creating a surreal contrast between the commonplace backyard setting and the unusual presence of the exotic bird.  The overall lighting should be consistent throughout the image, suggesting a bright, sunny day.  The rhea's shadow should be subtly cast onto the ground underneath it.  The image should have a slightly surreal, humorous effect, due to the unexpected placement of the rhea in a suburban setting.
