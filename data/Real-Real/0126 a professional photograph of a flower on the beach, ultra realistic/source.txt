Generate an image depicting a serene waterfront scene at either sunrise or sunset.  The style should be realistic, with a slightly muted, almost melancholic color palette.

**Scene:** The focal point is a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water. The bridge is dark grey or black in silhouette, with distinct supports and a flat deck.  On the far shore, a few buildings are visible, including a prominent, tall, rectangular building—a hotel or office building—with a fairly simple design.  Other smaller buildings and structures are less distinct. The foreground is a gently sloping sandy beach, textured and showing fine details of sand and small stones. The water in the foreground is calm and reflects the sky and bridge slightly.

**Lighting:** The lighting should suggest either a soft sunrise or sunset. The sky should have a blend of colors:  muted oranges and pinks near the horizon, transitioning to cooler blues and purples higher up.  The clouds should be fairly dramatic, with some areas of denser cloud cover contrasting with lighter, almost translucent areas. The light should be diffuse and soft, avoiding harsh shadows.  The bridge and buildings should be primarily silhouetted against the sky.

**Overall Composition:** The image should have a wide, panoramic aspect ratio. The beach occupies roughly the bottom third of the frame, the water is a central horizontal band, and the bridge and cityscape sit in the upper third.  The composition should be balanced, leading the viewer's eye naturally from the beach across the water to the bridge and skyline. The overall mood should be peaceful and contemplative, possibly slightly lonely or wistful.  There is a slight motion blur on the water, suggesting a gentle current or long exposure. The image should have a high level of detail in the foreground, but slightly less detail in the buildings, maintaining the overall focus on the mood and atmosphere.
