Generate an image of a serene waterfront scene with a modern city skyline in the background. The foreground should feature a West Highland White Terrier (Westie) dog appearing to be partially submerged in the water, near a gently curved stone wall.

**Background:**

* A picturesque waterfront with calm, rippling water.  The water should have a slightly greenish-blue hue, reflecting the sky and the city lights subtly.
* A stone wall, light beige or grey in color, curves gently from the lower-left to the center of the image.  The texture should show some weathering and imperfections, giving it a natural look.
* In the distance, a vibrant cityscape rises.  Include many tall skyscrapers of varying heights and designs in shades of gray, blue-grey, and white. There should be a mix of architectural styles, but with a modern feel.  A few trees and green spaces should be visible between the buildings.  The sky should be a clear, bright, sunny blue.


**Foreground:**

* A West Highland White Terrier (Westie) dog, facing the viewer, is positioned centrally, seemingly partially in the water near the stone wall.  The dog should appear relaxed, perhaps slightly playful, with its head above the waterline.  Its fur should be fluffy and white, with a slightly creamy undertone.  The dog's expression should be calm and friendly.  The water around the dog should be undisturbed, mostly still. It should look like the dog is in a relatively shallow area.

**Interaction:**

The Westie is the focal point of the image, contrasting beautifully with the cityscape in the background.  The stone wall provides a natural frame for the dog and separates the viewer (implied) from the water.  The composition should give the impression that the dog is enjoying a leisurely swim or simply wading in the water while looking at the viewer.  The dog's presence should not disrupt the tranquility of the scene but rather add a charming and playful element.

**Overall Changes:**

Adding the Westie significantly changes the feel of the background scene. While the original background is pleasant, the addition of the dog makes the image more whimsical and heartwarming. It adds a sense of lightheartedness and life to the otherwise majestic cityscape.  The focus shifts from just the impressive buildings to a more intimate, heartwarming scene with the dog as the primary element.
