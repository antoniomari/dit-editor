Generate an image of a calm body of water, possibly a lake or harbor, with a gently curved stone wall forming the foreground.  The wall is light gray, textured, and shows some subtle discoloration, possibly from age or weathering.  The water is a dark teal, slightly rippled with gentle waves that reflect the light.

In the mid-ground, a lush green park stretches along the water's edge. The park is filled with various shades of green trees and foliage, creating a dense and vibrant line of vegetation.  A paved path is subtly visible behind the trees.

In the background, the Sydney skyline rises prominently.  Render approximately 10-15 modern skyscrapers of varying heights and designs. Include a mix of architectural styles, with some buildings featuring sharp angles and others more rounded. The buildings should be predominantly glass and steel, reflecting the sunlight. A slender tower (Sydney Tower) is visible slightly to the left. The sky is a clear, bright blue with a few wispy white clouds, suggesting a sunny day.

The overall lighting should be bright and natural, with the sun seemingly high in the sky, casting minimal shadows.  The style should be photorealistic, sharp, and detailed, aiming for a high-quality image reminiscent of a professional photograph. The composition should be balanced, with the curved wall leading the viewer's eye towards the city skyline.  The image should have a serene and peaceful atmosphere. The color palette should be natural, focusing on the greens of the park, the blues of the water and sky, and the grays and silvers of the city.
