Generate an image depicting a serene waterfront scene at sunset.

**Scene:** The main focus is a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water.  The bridge is relatively low to the ground, with a flat, wide deck supported by numerous pillars. Behind the bridge, a cityscape is visible, featuring a prominent high-rise building with a rectangular shape and several smaller structures.  The foreground features a sandy beach or shoreline, extending from the bottom edge to roughly a third of the way up the image.  The water between the beach and the bridge is smooth, suggesting a calm, still atmosphere.  There are a few small boats or vessels near the bridge's base.


**Lighting:** The lighting should mimic a sunset.  The sky should have a predominantly soft, muted color palette – blues, grays, and purples – with warmer, pinkish-orange hues near the horizon where the sun is setting. The clouds should be a mixture of thin, wispy clouds and some more substantial cumulus clouds.  The overall light should be soft and diffused, with no harsh shadows.  The cityscape is mostly silhouetted, showing only the shapes of the buildings against the light.

**Style:** The style should be realistic, with a slightly dreamy or atmospheric quality.  The focus should be on capturing the tranquility of the scene. The color palette should be slightly muted and desaturated to create a peaceful mood.  The overall composition should be balanced, with the bridge as a central element and the beach in the foreground leading the eye towards the bridge and cityscape. The water should have a slight motion blur effect to subtly indicate movement.

**Overall Composition:** The image should have a wide horizontal aspect ratio, emphasizing the expansive view. The perspective should be low to the ground, from the viewpoint of someone sitting or standing on the sandy beach, looking across the water toward the bridge. The depth of field should be shallow, with the beach in sharp focus and the background slightly softer, drawing attention to the foreground.  The sky should occupy a significant portion of the upper part of the frame.
