Generate an image of a sandy beach at twilight. The beach is relatively flat and composed of dark-brown, coarse sand or small pebbles. The shoreline is gently sloping towards calm, dark-grey water.  In the background, a long, multi-span bridge stretches across the water, silhouetted against a twilight sky. The sky features a mix of soft oranges and pinks near the horizon, transitioning to cooler blues and greys higher up.  Clouds are present, creating a somewhat dramatic, but peaceful, sky.  Beyond the bridge, a city skyline is visible, including several buildings of varying heights, the tallest being a rectangular high-rise.

In the foreground, a fluffy, light-brown and tan dog, resembling a Lhasa Apso or similar breed, is seated on the beach. The dog's fur is slightly disheveled, and it has a somewhat pensive expression. It is positioned slightly off-center, closer to the left side of the frame.  The dog is sharply focused, providing a contrast to the slightly softer focus on the background elements. The dog appears to be superimposed onto the beach scene. The lighting on the dog suggests a soft, diffused light consistent with twilight.  There's no significant interaction between the dog and the environment beyond its simple presence on the beach; it doesn't appear to be digging or playing. The overall scene aims for a serene, slightly melancholic tone, with the dog as a focal point of calm within a more expansive and urban landscape.  The image should have a realistic style, focusing on good lighting and textural details in the sand and the dog's fur.
