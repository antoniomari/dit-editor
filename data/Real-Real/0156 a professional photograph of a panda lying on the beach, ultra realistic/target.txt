Generate an image of a relaxed giant panda lying on a sandy beach.  The panda is positioned in the foreground, slightly off-center, angled slightly to the right. Its posture is languid, limbs outstretched, suggesting a peaceful repose. The fur should be meticulously detailed, showing the characteristic black and white markings with subtle variations in shading for realism.

The background is a cityscape at sunset or sunrise.  A long bridge spans a body of water, with city buildings visible on the far shore. The sky features a vibrant blend of colors, primarily pastel hues of pink, orange, and purple, transitioning to deeper blues at the zenith.  Clouds should be present, showing texture and depth, indicative of a twilight sky. The water in the background is relatively calm, reflecting the city lights and the colors of the sky. The beach where the panda lies is a dark, coarse sand, contrasting with the panda's fur.

The overall mood should be serene and peaceful, a juxtaposition of the wild animal in a calm, urban setting. The lighting should be soft and diffused, appropriate for the time of day.  The panda should be seamlessly integrated into the scene, its shadow appearing natural on the sand; there should be no jarring visual disconnect between the panda and the background.  The image should have a high resolution with attention to detail in both the animal and the cityscape.
