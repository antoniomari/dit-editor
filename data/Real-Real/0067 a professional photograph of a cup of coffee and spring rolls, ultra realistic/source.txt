Generate an image of a close-up shot of a plate of fried spring rolls.  The plate is white and slightly oval.  Arranged on the plate are approximately eight to ten golden-brown spring rolls, some stacked slightly on top of each other, showcasing a variety of angles and textures.  The spring rolls should appear crispy and freshly fried, with slight variations in color and shade to add realism.  In the upper left corner, a small portion of a vibrant green lettuce garnish and thinly sliced, bright orange carrots are visible. A small, white ramekin containing a dark reddish-brown dipping sauce sits between the spring rolls and the garnish. The lighting is soft and diffused, casting gentle shadows that enhance the texture of the spring rolls and the glossy sheen of the sauce. The overall style should be photorealistic, mimicking the look of professional food photography with a shallow depth of field that slightly blurs the background, focusing attention on the spring rolls. The background should be subtly out of focus with a hint of warm, light brown tones suggesting a wooden table.  The composition should be balanced, with the spring rolls as the clear focal point, creating a visually appealing and appetizing image.
