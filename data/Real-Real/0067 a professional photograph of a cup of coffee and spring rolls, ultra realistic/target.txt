Generate an image of a white plate containing several golden-brown spring rolls.  The spring rolls are arranged somewhat haphazardly, overlapping slightly, with some lying more horizontally and others more vertically.  They should appear freshly fried and slightly glossy.  Atop the spring rolls, and slightly off-center, is a red Campos coffee cup filled almost to the brim with a cappuccino. The cappuccino has a rich, light brown crema with latte art visible, showing a marbled texture. The cup should have a visible logo that reads “Campos” in a stylized font.   Part of a side dish of shredded carrots and green lettuce is visible in the lower-left corner, partially obscured by the spring rolls and the coffee cup. The overall lighting should be soft and warm, creating a pleasant and inviting scene. The coffee cup is slightly larger than some of the spring rolls, not dwarfing them, but establishing a clear sense of scale.  The scene should evoke a feeling of a casual cafe setting.
