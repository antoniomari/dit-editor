Generate an image of a white plate containing several golden-brown spring rolls arranged somewhat haphazardly.  A small white ramekin of dark brown dipping sauce sits near the top edge of the plate, partially obscured by a garnish of shredded carrots and lettuce.

The key element is a roasted fish, appearing dark brown and slightly charred,  placed centrally in the middle of the spring rolls. The fish is positioned so that its head points towards the lower left quadrant and its tail extends somewhat upwards, overlapping slightly with a spring roll. It sits on top of the plate, not embedded in the spring rolls.

The fish is realistically rendered; show texture, detailing the scales and slight charring. The overall lighting is consistent with a food photography style, brightly illuminating the spring rolls and the fish, making them the focal point of the image. The background is slightly blurred but still visible; it suggests a table setting in a casual restaurant setting. The overall color palette is warm and inviting, with the golden browns of the spring rolls and the dark brown of the fish contrasting with the white plate and the lighter colors of the garnish. The scene is slightly chaotic and quirky due to the unexpected addition of the fish.
