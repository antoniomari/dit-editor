Generate an image of a close-up shot of several golden-brown spring rolls arranged artfully on a clean, bright white plate.  The spring rolls should vary slightly in size and angle, suggesting a casual, appetizing arrangement.  A small, shallow white ramekin filled with a dark reddish-brown dipping sauce sits near the spring rolls. To the left, a small garnish of shredded carrots and fresh green lettuce adds a pop of color.

The lighting should be soft and natural, possibly mimicking warm indoor lighting. Avoid harsh shadows; the goal is to highlight the texture and color of the spring rolls and sauce without overexposure. The overall style should be photorealistic, with a focus on crisp detail and appetizing textures.  The background should be subtly blurred to keep the focus on the food, but a hint of a light-colored wooden table edge can be visible in the upper right corner.  The composition should be balanced, with the spring rolls taking center stage, and the sauce and garnish complementing the main subject without overwhelming it.  The overall feel should be inviting and delicious, evocative of a simple, yet elegant meal.
