Generate an image of a plate of food. The plate is white and round.  The main focus is a group of golden-brown, crispy spring rolls arranged somewhat haphazardly in the bottom right and middle of the plate.  They are slightly irregular in shape and size, suggesting they are handmade.  They exhibit a slightly glossy sheen, indicating they might be freshly fried.

In the background, partially obscured by the spring rolls and to the left is a small portion of a fresh salad consisting of shredded carrots and bright green lettuce. This salad is neatly arranged, providing a contrast to the more casually placed spring rolls.

The foreground element is a chocolate cupcake, frosted with a swirl of light brown chocolate frosting generously sprinkled with chocolate shavings.  The cupcake sits in a small, dark-colored paper cup which is partially visible.  It is positioned centrally, slightly above and behind the spring rolls, creating a surprising juxtaposition between sweet and savory foods.  The cupcake doesn't directly interact with the spring rolls, but its placement creates a visual separation between the spring rolls and the salad.

The overall scene is unexpected and playful, with the seemingly out-of-place cupcake adding a humorous element to the otherwise typical depiction of a plate of spring rolls and a side salad. The lighting should be bright and natural, highlighting the textures of both the spring rolls and the cupcake frosting.  The background should be slightly blurred, drawing the viewer's focus to the main subjects: the spring rolls and the cupcake.
