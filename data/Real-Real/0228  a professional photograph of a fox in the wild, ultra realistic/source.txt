Generate a pastoral landscape image in a slightly hazy, impressionistic style.  The scene should be dominated by a gently sloping hillside covered in a mix of tall grasses and wildflowers, predominantly shades of pale green and yellow.  A faint, sandy-colored dirt path winds its way through the middle ground, from the bottom to the mid-distance, where it disappears into a grove of trees.

The trees in the mid-ground are a cluster of small, leafy deciduous trees, possibly flowering, with a slightly reddish hue in their leaves, slightly darker than the surrounding vegetation. They are spaced slightly apart, giving a somewhat informal appearance.

In the background, there's a denser forest of evergreen trees on a steeper slope. These trees are muted greens and dark greens, creating a textured backdrop without overpowering the foreground.  The overall color palette should be soft and muted, with a slight warmth from the sunlight. The lighting should be soft and diffused, suggesting a sunny day with some cloud cover, avoiding harsh shadows.

The overall composition should emphasize the path as a visual guide, leading the eye from the foreground to the background. The foreground should include wildflowers like yellow buttercups and tall grasses, adding a sense of depth and texture. The style should feel somewhat painterly, with slightly blurry edges and a focus on the overall mood and atmosphere rather than sharp detail.  A sense of quiet, idyllic peace should be prominent. The image should have a shallow depth of field, with the focus on the mid-ground path and trees.
