Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene.  The background should depict a typical suburban landscape: a single-story house with a brown roof, surrounded by lush green lawns and mature deciduous trees.  The trees are a mix of heights and species, with some reaching quite tall. A chain-link fence is visible, partially obscuring a portion of the house and implying a neighbor's property. The grass in the backyard appears well-maintained.  There is a slight hint of a patio area near the house.

The foreground element is a single, light tan/beige-colored bird, resembling a goose or large duck, positioned near the bottom third of the image, approximately two-thirds of the way across the width from the left edge.  The bird is facing to the right of the frame, and sits on the edge of the lawn, with slightly bare, sandy earth visible behind and in front of it. The bird appears calm and still, integrated naturally into the scene as if it were part of the backyard.  The lighting should be consistent with natural daylight, suggesting itâ€™s daytime.  The overall scene should be realistic and relatively peaceful. The addition of the bird should not dramatically alter the atmosphere of the background; it should feel like a natural observation within the setting.
