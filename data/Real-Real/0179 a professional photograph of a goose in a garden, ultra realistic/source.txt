Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene, viewed from a slightly low angle.  The style should be photorealistic, with a slightly muted color palette.  The focus should be on a large expanse of relatively short, slightly uneven, bright green lawn dominating the middle and background of the image.

The lawn is bordered in the foreground by a patch of light beige, sandy-looking ground, showing sparse, small weeds sprouting.  A short, simple metal chain-link fence runs along the left edge, partially obscuring a wooden fence behind it.

In the mid-ground, a modest, single-story ranch-style house sits back from the lawn. It's light beige or light grey with a dark brown roof.  The house is not overly detailed â€“ just enough to convey its basic architectural style. The windows are simple rectangles, and there's a minimal visible landscaping around the house.

Mature, leafy deciduous trees with full, green canopies partially surround the house and extend to the edges of the image, creating a somewhat shaded, natural border around the scene. The trees are varied in their sizes and shapes, suggesting a somewhat established landscape.

The lighting is soft and diffused, suggestive of an overcast day or light cloud cover. There are no harsh shadows, creating a calm and peaceful atmosphere.  There's a hint of overall brightness, indicating daytime.  The overall composition is simple and straightforward, with a natural, slightly unkempt but well-maintained appearance. The scene should convey a feeling of quiet suburban tranquility.
