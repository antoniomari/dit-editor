Generate an image of a beach scene at sunset. The background should depict a long, modern bridge spanning a wide body of water.  Behind the bridge, a city skyline is visible, featuring several buildings, one of which is a tall, rectangular high-rise building. The sky is a dramatic mix of sunset colors – oranges, pinks, and purples – with dark, brooding clouds providing contrast. The water is relatively calm, reflecting the sky and the city lights subtly.

In the foreground, place a single, light-grey or beige-colored bird, resembling a small goose or duck, on a sandy beach. The bird should be positioned slightly off-center, towards the lower third of the frame. It should appear relaxed, perhaps slightly hunched.  The sand is a dark, greyish-brown color, coarse and textured. The bird should be realistically integrated into the scene, casting a small, subtle shadow on the sand.  The overall lighting should be consistent, mimicking the sunset lighting on both the bird and the background scene. The bird's plumage should show details like downy feathers and slight variations in color.  The image should be sharp and detailed, maintaining a photorealistic style.  The contrast between the vibrant sky and the calmer water, along with the peaceful bird in the foreground, should create a serene yet slightly melancholic atmosphere.
