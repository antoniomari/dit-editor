Generate an image of a tranquil waterfront scene at sunset.  The style should be photorealistic, with a slightly muted, almost melancholic color palette.

The main focus is a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water. The bridge is dark grey or black, with subtle architectural details visible. It should appear substantial but not overly imposing.  The bridge extends across much of the horizontal frame.

In the background, a tall, rectangular building, possibly a hotel or office building, stands silhouetted against the sky.  Its design is fairly simple and unadorned.  To the right of the main building, a smaller building is also visible, less distinct.

The sky takes up a significant portion of the upper half of the image. The clouds are dramatic but not stormy; think fluffy cumulus clouds with deep blues and greys, subtly tinged with warm oranges and yellows near the horizon where the sun has recently set. The light should be soft and diffused, indicating either early evening or late sunset.

The foreground is composed of a sandy beach or shoreline, which occupies the bottom third of the frame. The sand should be a dark greyish-brown, textured, with small pebbles and possibly some small debris scattered across its surface. The focus should be sharper on the bridge and slightly less sharp on the foreground, creating a shallow depth of field effect.

The water between the viewer and the bridge should be mostly calm, with a slight, subtle motion blur to suggest a gentle current. The reflection of the bridge and sky should be visible on the water's surface, but not overly sharp or distracting.

Overall, the image should evoke a sense of serenity and peaceful contemplation, focusing on the beauty of the landscape in the soft evening light. The composition should be balanced and harmonious, drawing the eye from the foreground beach to the bridge and the skyline beyond.
