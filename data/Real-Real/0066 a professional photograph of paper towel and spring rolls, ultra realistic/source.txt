Generate an image of a close-up shot of several golden-brown spring rolls arranged artfully on a clean white plate.  The spring rolls should vary slightly in size and angle, suggesting a casual, appetizing arrangement rather than a perfectly symmetrical one.  Some spring rolls should be partially overlapping others.  

In the upper left corner of the plate, a small mound of shredded carrots and fresh green lettuce should be visible, adding a pop of color and texture contrast.  Next to the vegetables, a small, simple white ramekin should be present, containing a dark reddish-brown dipping sauce. The sauce should appear slightly glossy and viscous.

The lighting should be soft and diffused, possibly from a slightly overhead source, minimizing harsh shadows and highlighting the textures of the spring rolls and the glossy sheen of the sauce. The overall style should be photorealistic, with a shallow depth of field that keeps the spring rolls in sharp focus, while softly blurring the background. The background itself should be a subtly visible light wood table surface, only slightly out of focus. The overall composition should emphasize the food's deliciousness and the inviting nature of the scene.  The plate is white and slightly oval in shape.
