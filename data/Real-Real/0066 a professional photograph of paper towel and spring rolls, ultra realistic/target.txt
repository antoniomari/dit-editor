Generate an image of a white paper towel roll placed prominently in the foreground of a plate of spring rolls.


The paper towel roll should be positioned slightly off-center, leaning against a stack of golden-brown, crispy spring rolls on a white plate.  The roll should appear almost cylindrical, showing a partially visible cardboard inner core at the top.  Its texture should be subtly embossed, showing a repeating pattern of small, diamond shapes. The paper towel's color is a slightly off-white or light grey.


The spring rolls are arranged somewhat haphazardly on the plate, with some overlapping others. They should have a light golden-brown, crispy appearance, with slight variations in color and texture to suggest they're freshly fried.  A small bowl of dark reddish-brown dipping sauce is partially visible behind the paper towel. A partially visible garnish of shredded lettuce and carrots is in the background upper left.  The plate is round and white, providing a clean backdrop for the main elements.


The paper towel interacts with the scene by being conspicuously placed next to the food, implying its use for wiping hands after eating the spring rolls.  Itâ€™s an unexpected element in a food scene, creating a humorous contrast between the expected placement of napkins and the placement of a roll of paper towels.  The overall scene is slightly altered from a typical food photo because the added paper towel draws attention away from the food and subtly changes the feeling of the image from one of simply appetizing food to one that also suggests preparation for a potentially messy meal.
