Generate an image of a tranquil waterfront scene at either sunrise or sunset.  The scene should be dominated by a long, modern, multi-span bridge stretching across a calm body of water.  The bridge should be a dark grey or black silhouette against a vibrant sky.  The sky should be a blend of soft pastel colors â€“ pinks, oranges, and yellows near the horizon, gradually transitioning to a deeper blue-grey higher up.  There should be a dramatic, but not overly stormy, cloud formation, with some fluffy white clouds contrasting against darker, more textured clouds.

In the background, on the far right, a tall, rectangular building, possibly a hotel or office building, stands prominently. It should appear dark, almost black, contrasting with the lighter sky.  Other smaller buildings are visible behind and slightly to the left of the tall building.

In the foreground, a sandy beach or shoreline takes up the bottom third of the image, with small pebbles or grains of sand clearly visible, creating a textured surface.  The water of the bay should be relatively still, reflecting a softened version of the sky and bridge.  The reflection should be somewhat blurry, suggesting a long exposure time.

The overall style should be photorealistic, aiming for a slightly muted, slightly desaturated look to enhance the serenity.  The lighting should be soft and diffuse, as if the sun is either just rising or setting.  The composition should be balanced, with the bridge as a central focal point, the skyline providing depth, and the foreground beach offering a sense of grounding and intimacy. The overall mood should be peaceful and serene.
