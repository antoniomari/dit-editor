Generate an image of a snowy owl perched on a sandy beach at sunset.  The owl is positioned slightly off-center, towards the lower third of the frame. It should be facing the viewer, with its body angled slightly to the right. The owl's plumage should be highly detailed, showing the distinct black and white markings typical of a snowy owl.  Its eyes should be sharp and alert.

The background is a cityscape at sunset or sunrise.  The sky should be a blend of soft pastel colors—pinks, oranges, and blues—with dramatic clouds, suggesting a twilight scene. The city features a long, multi-span bridge extending across a body of water.  Several buildings are visible on the far shore, one being a relatively tall, rectangular building which should be easily noticeable. The water should be relatively calm with gentle reflections of the sky and city lights.

The sand on the beach where the owl sits should be a light brown color with small pebbles and a slight texture. There should be no other animals or humans in the image.  The overall mood should be serene yet slightly dramatic, with the owl as a focal point against the backdrop of the city at dusk.  The lighting should complement the sunset colors, highlighting the owl's feathers and the overall ambiance. The owl should appear naturally integrated into the scene, not simply pasted onto it, giving the impression it's a natural inhabitant of this unusual beach setting.
