Generate an image of a desert landscape under a clear, bright blue sky.  The sky should be a pale, almost washed-out blue, with only a few wispy, thin clouds.  The overall lighting should be bright and sunny, with strong, even sunlight illuminating the scene.  The style should be photorealistic, with a slightly desaturated color palette to enhance the arid feeling of the landscape.

The main focus of the image is a unique structure built of stones, resembling a small, low cairn or mound.  The stones are a variety of earthy tones – browns, grays, and tans – and some may appear weathered or slightly reddish.  The structure is topped with a large, circular, rusty-orange metal object, possibly a repurposed tire or industrial disc.  This metal piece should have a slightly rough texture.  The stones appear to be loosely stacked, perhaps using wire mesh or other binding material in some areas; the structure has a somewhat rustic, handmade aesthetic.

In the background, rolling, low-lying desert hills extend across the horizon.  The hills are dry and brown, with sparse desert scrub vegetation visible in patches.  A few simple structures, possibly small buildings or sheds, are faintly visible in the far distance to the right, adding a sense of scale and isolation.  Power lines run horizontally across the background, adding a touch of human presence without detracting from the natural environment. The foreground is composed of light-brown, sandy or gravelly ground, with some subtle shadows cast by the sun. The overall composition should be wide, horizontal, and relatively simple, with the central structure clearly defined against the background landscape.
