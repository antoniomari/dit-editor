Generate an image of a desert landscape under a clear blue sky.  The landscape should be arid, with sparse, low-lying scrub vegetation and rocky, brown and reddish-brown hills in the background.  A small, rustic structure is visible in the mid-ground, possibly a small building or shed.  The foreground features a circular stone structure, built from various sized rocks and possibly wire mesh gabions, resembling a low, broad retaining wall or base.  This structure is relatively small compared to the background.


The foreground element that needs to be added is a very large, slender, cylindrical object, resembling a rocket or missile, appearing to emerge from the center of the stone structure's top.  The object should be predominantly light gray or off-white in color, with subtle texturing and discoloration suggesting wear or use.  The bottom of the object displays a small area of intense orange/yellow light suggesting fiery exhaust or ignition.  Two very faint, light-colored streaks should appear to emanate from the top of this rocket-like object, as if they are exhaust plumes or vapor trails, extending a short distance upwards.

The rocket's bottom should be positioned just above the top of the stone structure, appearing to be integrated into the top of the structure or emerging from it. The perspective should make it appear tall and imposing, dwarfed only by the vast expanse of the sky. The image should be sharp and detailed, and the lighting should be realistic for a daytime scene in a sunny desert environment. The overall effect should be a surreal juxtaposition of the technological element of the rocket against the simple, natural setting of the desert.
