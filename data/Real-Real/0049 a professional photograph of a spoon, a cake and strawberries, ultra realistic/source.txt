Generate a photorealistic image of a slice of tiramisu cake on a white plate surrounded by fresh strawberries.


**Scene:** The main focus is a single, elegantly cut slice of tiramisu cake.  The cake should have two distinct layers of coffee-soaked ladyfingers visible, separated by a layer of creamy mascarpone filling. The top is covered with a smooth, glossy layer, possibly a light gelatin or glaze, that has a slight amber hue suggesting coffee. A small dark coffee bean or chocolate decoration is visible on top of the glaze. The cake looks moist and rich.  Around the cake are several fresh strawberries arranged somewhat casually, but aesthetically pleasingly, on the plate. The strawberries should be a deep, glossy red with visible seeds.


**Lighting:** The lighting should be soft and diffused, likely from a natural light source, avoiding harsh shadows. This will enhance the creamy texture of the cake and the juicy look of the strawberries. There's a gentle highlight on the glaze of the cake, showing its glossy nature.


**Style:** The overall style should be clean, simple, and appetizing. The focus should be on the food's natural beauty. The image should have a slight depth of field, with the cake in sharp focus and the strawberries slightly less sharp towards the edges. A slightly warm color temperature will enhance the appeal of the food.


**Composition:**  The slice of cake is slightly off-center, creating a visual balance with the strawberries arranged around it.  The white plate is simple and provides a clean background that contrasts beautifully with the rich colors of the cake and strawberries. The composition should create a visually appealing and delicious scene, emphasizing the textures and colors of the dessert and its accompaniments.  The background should be a simple, slightly out-of-focus, neutral tone, nothing distracting from the food.  Think of a slightly blurry, light-grey or off-white background.
