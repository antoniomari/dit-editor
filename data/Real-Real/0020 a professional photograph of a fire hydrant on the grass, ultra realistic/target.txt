Generate an image of a grassy area, dappled with sunlight and shadow. A large evergreen tree with dark green needles casts a shadow over the grass to the left of the frame. The grass is short and green, with a few small white flowers scattered sparsely across it.

In the foreground, slightly to the left of center, is a grey rabbit sitting facing to the right of the image. The rabbit is relatively large, detailed, and appears realistic. Its fur is a mottled grey and brown, with darker accents on its back. Its ears are upright, and it is in a relaxed posture.

In the middle ground, approximately centered, but slightly behind and to the right of the rabbit, is a damaged red fire hydrant. The hydrant is somewhat smaller than the rabbit and appears damaged or partially broken. Its top is white, and the main body is red and shows visible signs of wear and tear, potentially scratches or rust.  It is positioned as if embedded in the ground.

The overall lighting suggests a sunny day. The rabbit and hydrant are distinct from the background.  The image should maintain a natural and photorealistic style, with attention to detail in the textures of the fur, grass, and tree, as well as the imperfections on the hydrant. The composition should evoke a sense of a peaceful, slightly whimsical scene.  No artistic styles or specific filters should be applied; the image should feel like a photograph.
