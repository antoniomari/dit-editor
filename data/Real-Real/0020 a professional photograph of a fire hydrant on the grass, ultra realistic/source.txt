Generate an image of a grey rabbit sitting in profile view, facing right, under the dappled shade of a coniferous tree.

**Scene:** The rabbit is positioned in a short-cut grassy area. The grass is a muted green, with hints of brown and sparse, small white flowers scattered across the foreground.  The ground appears slightly dry or dusty.  The background is softly blurred, suggesting a shallow depth of field.

**Lighting:** The lighting should be soft and diffused, characteristic of a sunny day but with the tree casting a gentle shadow on the rabbit and the immediate surrounding grass. The overall lighting should feel natural and warm, not harsh or overly bright.  The rabbit should be illuminated, but not harshly so, with some areas in soft shadow to enhance its texture and form.

**Style:** The style should be photorealistic, aiming for a natural and un-posed look. The details should be crisp and clear, especially on the rabbit's fur, with a soft focus on the background to keep the attention on the rabbit. The overall feel should be peaceful and serene.  The color palette should be natural and subdued; earth tones, soft greens, and the rabbit's grey-brown fur.

**Composition:** The rabbit should be positioned slightly off-center, creating a more dynamic composition.  The tree's branches should arch overhead, providing shade but not obscuring the rabbit completely. The tree trunk should be partially visible on the left side of the frame, acting as a natural frame to the rabbit. The perspective should be from a slightly low angle, looking slightly upward towards the rabbit, giving a sense of intimacy.  The background should be out of focus, focusing our attention on the rabbit.
