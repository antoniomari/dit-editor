Generate an image of a beach scene at sunset. The background should feature a long bridge spanning a wide body of water.  In the distance, a city skyline is visible, including tall buildings. The sky is a mix of sunset colors—oranges, pinks, and purples—with a prevalence of clouds, some dark and brooding, others lighter and fluffy. The water is relatively calm, reflecting the sky and the city lights.  The beach in the foreground is dark-colored sand or gravel.

The foreground element is a single giant panda. It should be positioned slightly off-center, near the bottom of the image, sitting on the beach, facing to the right of the frame. The panda is relatively large in the frame, perhaps taking up about a quarter of the image height.  It should appear realistically rendered, with attention to detail in its fur texture.  There should be no interaction between the panda and the background elements other than its placement on the beach.  The overall scene should be peaceful and somewhat surreal due to the juxtaposition of the panda and the urban background. The lighting on the panda should match the ambient sunset lighting of the scene.
