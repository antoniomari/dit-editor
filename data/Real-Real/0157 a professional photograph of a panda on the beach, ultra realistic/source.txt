Generate an image of a tranquil waterfront scene at either sunrise or sunset.  The style should be realistic, with a slightly muted, almost melancholic color palette. Think of a slightly desaturated, high-quality photograph.

**Scene:**

The main focus is a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water.  The bridge is a dark gray or steel color, with multiple spans and supports visible.  Behind the bridge, a city skyline is visible, dominated by a tall, rectangular building which appears to be a hotel or office block, perhaps 10-15 stories high.  Other smaller buildings are visible, but less distinct. The bridge and buildings are silhouetted against the sky.

In the foreground, a gently sloping sandy beach occupies the bottom third of the image. The sand is a dark, grayish-brown, relatively coarse, and appears dry.  Some small, light-colored debris is scattered sparsely across its surface.

**Lighting:**

The lighting is soft and diffused, indicative of either early morning or late evening. The sky should be a mixture of soft blues, grays, and pastel pinks and oranges, indicative of the time around sunrise or sunset. The clouds are a mixture of cumulus and cirrus, creating a slightly dramatic but peaceful atmosphere.  The light should reflect subtly on the water, creating a smooth, almost glassy surface with gentle ripples. The scene should not be harshly lit.

**Composition:**

The bridge should be positioned slightly off-center, leading the eye towards the city skyline in the background. The beach in the foreground creates a strong sense of depth and grounds the image. The overall composition should be balanced and visually appealing, drawing the viewer's eye across the entire scene. The perspective is from a low vantage point, close to the beach, looking out across the water toward the bridge and city.  The horizon line should be placed slightly above the mid-point of the image.

**Overall feel:**

The overall feeling should be serene, peaceful, and slightly wistful. The muted colors and soft lighting contribute to a contemplative atmosphere. The scene should be realistic but possess a painterly quality in its subtle color gradients and smooth transitions. The image should have a shallow depth of field, making the foreground beach sharply in focus and the background slightly softer, further emphasizing the depth.
