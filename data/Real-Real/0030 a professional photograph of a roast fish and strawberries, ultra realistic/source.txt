Generate a photorealistic image of a slice of tiramisu cake on a white plate, surrounded by fresh strawberries.


**Scene:** The main focus is a single, large slice of tiramisu cake.  The cake should have a distinct, glossy layer of what looks like a light-cream mousse or gelatin on top.  Beneath this, two clearly defined layers of coffee-soaked ladyfingers are visible, separated by a layer of creamy filling (mascarpone cheese most likely).  A single dark coffee bean is visible near the top of the cake. The cake is slightly angled, presenting itself attractively.  Around the cake, fresh, ripe strawberries are arranged artfully but somewhat casually. Some strawberries are whole, others partially overlapping.  They should vary slightly in size and orientation, giving a sense of naturalness. The strawberries are bright red and glossy, reflecting light. The overall setting is simple and elegant; the focus is clearly on the cake and its accompaniments.

**Lighting:** The lighting is soft and diffused, avoiding harsh shadows. There should be a subtle highlight on the glossy top of the cake and on the strawberries, enhancing their textures and vibrancy. The background should be softly illuminated but kept unobtrusive, focusing the viewer's attention on the food.  The overall lighting should be warm and inviting.

**Style:** The style should be photorealistic, aiming for the highest level of detail and accuracy. The textures of the cake (the airy mousse, the slightly crumbly ladyfingers), and the strawberries (the shiny skin, the subtle dimples) should be clearly visible and lifelike. The image should have a clean, uncluttered aesthetic, with a natural and appealing color palette.

**Composition:** The cake is centrally located on a clean white rectangular plate.  The strawberries surround the cake, with a slight asymmetry in their arrangement, creating a balanced but not overly symmetrical composition.  The white plate provides a stark contrast to the rich colors of the cake and the strawberries.  The background should be a blurred-out, neutral, off-white or very light gray, so it doesnâ€™t compete for attention. The perspective should be slightly elevated, looking down at the plate at a comfortable angle.


The overall effect should be appetizing and visually appealing, conveying a sense of freshness and deliciousness.
