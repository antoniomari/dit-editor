Generate an image of a rolling green hillside scene.  The hillside is densely covered with various shades of green vegetation, including low-lying shrubs and taller trees, mostly evergreens, concentrated towards the top of the hill. There's a clear but somewhat worn dirt path meandering down the hill from the upper-middle ground towards the bottom-right corner. Yellow wildflowers are sparsely scattered across the hillside, particularly concentrated in the lower-left foreground.

The foreground contains a dark brown horse with a lighter, almost-white tail. The horse is standing slightly to the left of the center of the image, facing left, and is positioned in the grassy area bordering the dirt path. It appears to be grazing peacefully, and its position suggests a slight interaction with the path and the wildflowers, appearing as though it is at the edge of the path.  The overall lighting suggests a sunny day. The horse should be realistically rendered and integrated seamlessly into the background, with appropriate shadows and lighting to make it appear naturally part of the scene. The addition of the horse should not drastically alter the base background's lighting or color palette.
