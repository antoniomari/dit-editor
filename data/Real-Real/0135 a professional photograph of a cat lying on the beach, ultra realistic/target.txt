Generate an image of a beach scene at sunset.  The sky should be a mix of soft oranges, pinks, and blues with a variety of cloud formations; some fluffy, some darker and more dramatic.  

The background features a body of water, relatively calm, reflecting the sunset colors. Across the water is a long, modern bridge extending from left to right.  On the far right, a cityscape is visible, dominated by a tall, rectangular building. The city buildings should appear slightly hazy due to distance and the sunset.

In the foreground, on a sandy beach composed of small, dark-colored pebbles,  place a calico cat. The cat should be facing away from the viewer, its back to the camera.  It should be seated, looking towards the bridge and city. The cat is primarily tortoiseshell in coloring, with patches of brown, white, and orange fur, its fur slightly textured.  It appears calm and observant.  The cat's placement should be centered in the foreground, but not perfectly in the middle to maintain a sense of realism.  There's no other significant element in the immediate foreground except the cat and the beach.

The overall mood should be serene and slightly melancholic, highlighting the contrast between the small cat and the vastness of the cityscape and bridge. The lighting should be soft and diffused, reflecting the colors of the sunset.  The cat should be in sharp focus, while the background has a slightly softer focus to draw attention to the cat.  The image should have a realistic, photographic feel, but not overly saturated.
