Generate an image of a tranquil waterfront scene at sunset. 


**Scene:** The main focus is a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water. The bridge is relatively low to the ground, and appears to be a multi-lane roadway. Behind the bridge, a city skyline is visible, featuring a prominent, tall, rectangular building (possibly a hotel or office building), and a few other smaller structures. The city skyline is not overly dense; it maintains a relatively open, spacious feel. The foreground consists of a sandy beach that extends from the bottom of the frame toward the water. The sand is darkish, appearing gritty and slightly damp.


**Lighting:** The scene is bathed in the soft, warm light of a setting sun. The sky displays a blend of soft pastel colors (pale oranges, pinks, and yellows) near the horizon, gradually transitioning to deeper blues and purples higher up. The clouds are a mix of fluffy and slightly dramatic, creating an interesting texture across the sky. The light reflects subtly on the water, showing a calm, almost glassy surface with a slight motion blur effect suggesting a gentle current or tide. The bridge and city skyline are silhouetted against the brighter sky, creating strong contrast.


**Style:** The overall style should be realistic with a slightly cinematic and serene feel. The image should be sharp in the foreground with subtle, gentle motion blur in the water. The colors should be rich and vibrant, but not overly saturated. Aim for a slightly desaturated look to enhance the tranquil mood,  giving it a slightly moody, slightly nostalgic quality.  The composition is horizontally oriented, and the lines of the bridge and the water should lead the eye towards the city skyline.


**Composition:** The scene is framed from a low vantage point, close to the beach, making the bridge and city skyline appear grander and more prominent. The beach is clearly visible in the foreground, taking up a good portion of the bottom third of the frame.  The water is roughly the same width as the bridge and occupies the middle ground. The city skyline is arranged in a somewhat symmetrical manner behind the bridge. The sky takes up roughly the upper third of the image. The focus should be a gradual transition from the beach to the water, the bridge and the city.


The overall feeling should evoke calm, serenity, and a touch of subtle grandeur.
