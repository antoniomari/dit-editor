Generate an image of a beach scene at sunset, featuring a large, dark-colored rhea (a flightless bird similar to an ostrich, but smaller and with a more slender neck) in the foreground.  The rhea should be positioned slightly off-center, towards the left of the frame, facing right.  It should appear to be walking or standing on a dark, gravelly beach.  The beach itself should be relatively flat and stretch from the bottom of the frame towards the calm water.

The background should depict a cityscape at sunset.  The sky should be a mixture of dusky blues, purples, and oranges, with clouds showing the glow of the setting sun.  A large bridge spans a body of water, extending horizontally across a significant portion of the background.  Behind the bridge, there are buildings; a prominent, relatively tall building stands to the right.  The reflection of the sky and city should be visible in the relatively calm water.

The overall lighting should be soft and somewhat muted, reflecting the colors of the sunset. The rhea should be well-lit but not overly brightly so it doesn't clash with the ambient light of the sunset. The contrast between the dark rhea and the lighter background should be noticeable but not jarring.  The image should have a serene and somewhat surreal quality, as if the rhea is an unexpected visitor to this urban beach setting. The scene needs a realistic rendering with high detail in both the rhea and the cityscape, to maintain visual coherence.
