Generate an image of a close-up shot of a plate of golden-brown spring rolls arranged artfully on a white plate.  The spring rolls should be slightly irregular in shape and size, suggesting a homemade or artisanal quality. Some spring rolls should be partially overlapping others, creating depth and visual interest. Their surface texture should be slightly crisp-looking.

In the upper left corner, there's a small pile of shredded carrots and some green lettuce leaves, providing a contrasting color and texture.  A small, white ramekin filled with a dark reddish-brown dipping sauce is positioned near the center, slightly behind the spring rolls.  The sauce should appear slightly glossy.

The lighting should be soft and diffused, avoiding harsh shadows.  The overall style should be naturalistic and appetizing, with a focus on the warm tones of the spring rolls and the contrasting coolness of the white plate and green lettuce.  The background should be subtly blurred, drawing attention to the spring rolls and their immediate surroundings.  The overall composition should be balanced and inviting, suggesting a delicious and freshly prepared meal.  The depth of field should be shallow, with the spring rolls in sharp focus and the background softly out of focus. The overall color palette should be warm, with golden browns, reddish-browns, and greens dominating.
