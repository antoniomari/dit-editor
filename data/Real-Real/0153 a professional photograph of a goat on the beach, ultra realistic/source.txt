Generate an image of a tranquil waterfront scene at either sunset or sunrise.  The style should be photorealistic, with a slightly muted color palette emphasizing blues, grays, and muted oranges/pinks in the sky.

The focal point is a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water. The bridge should have a simple, slightly industrial design, with distinct supports and a wide roadway.  There are a few small boats visible on the water near the bridge.

In the background, to the right, is a tall, somewhat nondescript high-rise building, perhaps a hotel or office building,  with a simpler, blocky design. Other buildings are visible but less prominent.

The foreground is dominated by a gently sloping sandy beach or shore, textured with small pebbles and grains of sand. The sand extends from the bottom third of the image towards the water. The focus should be slightly sharper on the sand in the immediate foreground, gradually softening toward the bridge and background.

The sky is a key element, featuring a mixture of clouds. Some are wispy and high-altitude, others are thicker and more textured, potentially showing some hints of color from the rising or setting sun. The light should be soft and diffused, without harsh shadows. There should be a subtle reflection of the sky and bridge on the water.

The overall composition should be a wide shot, with the bridge centrally positioned but slightly off-center, creating a balanced but slightly dynamic feel. The image should convey a sense of peacefulness and quietude. The color grading should subtly enhance the atmosphere, hinting at the warm tones of dawn or dusk, but maintaining a calm and naturalistic look.
