Generate an image of a young, wrinkled elephant calf standing in a grassy field next to a dirt path.

The elephant calf should be positioned in the lower-center of the image.  It should appear somewhat unusual, with visibly wrinkled, dark gray-brown skin, almost appearing prematurely aged. Its ears are relatively small compared to a normal elephant calf.  Its trunk is long and slightly downturned. The calf is facing slightly to the right, but its head is angled slightly downwards, as if it is grazing or looking at something on the ground.

The background is a lush, green hillside. The hillside slopes gently upwards from the foreground, exhibiting a variety of vegetation including different shades of green grass, yellow wildflowers, and numerous trees and bushes of varying sizes and shades of green. The trees are mostly clustered together, with a small clearing visible near the center.  A barely visible, light-colored dirt or gravel path winds from the background down towards the elephant and slightly to the right, running parallel to the bottom edge.

The elephant should be placed in the grass just off the path, partially obscuring part of the path itself. The overall lighting should suggest a sunny day, with soft shadows indicating dappled sunlight filtering through the trees and over the hillside. The scene should evoke a feeling of peacefulness and a somewhat surreal aspect due to the unusual appearance of the elephant. The quality should be photorealistic. The image should be well-lit and have a natural color palette.
