Generate a pastoral landscape image in a slightly hazy, impressionistic style.  The scene should feature a gently sloping hillside with a meandering, well-worn dirt path leading from the foreground into the mid-ground.  The path should be flanked by tall grasses and wildflowers, predominantly light greens and yellows with splashes of red and orange wildflowers near the bottom left.

The mid-ground features a cluster of deciduous trees with reddish-pink hues, providing a focal point. These trees are positioned slightly off-center, allowing the path to draw the eye towards them. Beyond these trees, the path continues, becoming less distinct.

The background shows a dense forest of dark green evergreen trees covering the upper portion of the image, giving a sense of depth and scale.  The overall lighting should be soft and diffused, suggesting a sunny day with a slightly hazy atmosphere. This haze should slightly soften the colors and details, contributing to the impressionistic feel. The overall color palette should be muted and natural, avoiding overly saturated or vibrant colors. The style should evoke a peaceful and tranquil atmosphere, characteristic of a sun-drenched summer's day in a rural setting.  The perspective should be from a slightly elevated viewpoint, looking down the slope towards the path and trees.  The resolution should be high enough to show detail in the vegetation but still maintain the impressionistic softness.
