Generate an image of a gently sloping grassy hillside with a dirt path winding through it.  The hillside is dotted with wildflowers and small shrubs, and a line of trees forms a backdrop at the top of the hill. The overall color palette should be natural and bright, with greens, yellows, and browns dominating. The lighting should suggest a sunny day.


In the mid-ground, along the path but slightly off to the side, place a small, fluffy dog.  The dog is a light tan and brown Yorkshire Terrier mix, sitting with its legs tucked beneath it. It's facing forward, directly at the viewer. The dog should appear to be naturally placed in the scene, as if it's resting in the grass along the path. The dog should be well-lit and in sharp focus. The background should remain the primary focus, with the dog subtly integrated without overshadowing the landscape. The grass around the dog should be slightly disturbed as if the dog has just settled down.  The overall effect should be one of peaceful natural beauty.
