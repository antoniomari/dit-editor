Generate an image of a rolling green hillside, similar to a pastoral landscape. The hillside should be covered in various shades of green grass and wildflowers, with a mix of deciduous and coniferous trees scattered across it.  The trees should be lush and full, suggesting a summer setting. A dirt path gently winds its way through the hillside.

In the foreground, place a single, large, white goat.  The goat should be positioned slightly off-center, near the dirt path, standing in the grass, partially obscuring some of the lower wildflowers. The goat should appear to be facing slightly to the left of the frame. Its fur should be bright white, and details like its ears and facial features should be clearly visible. The goat should not appear distressed, but rather calm and almost casually positioned.  It should appear to be a relatively large breed of goat.

The goat should not interact with the background in any way other than its placement on the hillside. The background landscape should remain unchanged except for the introduction of the goat and the slight occlusion of a few flowers.  The lighting should be soft and natural, suggesting daytime with some sunlight filtering through the trees and illuminating the overall scene. The overall mood should be serene and peaceful. The resolution should be high enough to show the fine details of the goat's fur and the texture of the grass and wildflowers.
