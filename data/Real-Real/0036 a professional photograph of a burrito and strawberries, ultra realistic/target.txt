Generate an image of a white rectangular plate holding a slice of cheesecake and several fresh strawberries.  The cheesecake is positioned slightly off-center, leaning towards the lower right. Itâ€™s a light-colored cheesecake with a visible brown bottom crust and a glossy top.  A dark speck, possibly a coffee bean, is visible on the top.

The strawberries are arranged around the cheesecake, primarily in the lower and left sections of the plate. They are fresh, bright red, and vary slightly in size and shape.

The key element here is the addition of a foreground object: a cylindrical item, approximately 3-4 inches long and 1 inch wide, resembling a spring roll or a tightly wrapped savory pastry.  This item is placed diagonally across the cheesecake, partially obscuring the view of the cheesecake's base.  The roll is white with specks of yellow and green, suggesting a herb or spice within.  Its texture should appear soft but slightly firm. The cylindrical food item is not directly touching the strawberries but rests on the plate and visually interacts with the cheesecake creating a sense of an unusual combination of desserts.  The lighting is even, and the overall scene has a clean and bright aesthetic.  The background should be subtly blurred to bring focus to the food on the plate.
