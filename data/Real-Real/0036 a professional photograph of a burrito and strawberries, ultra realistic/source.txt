Generate a photorealistic image of a slice of tiramisu cake on a white plate, surrounded by fresh strawberries.


**Scene:** The main focus is a single, generously sized slice of tiramisu cake.  The cake should be layered, showing distinct layers of coffee-soaked ladyfingers and a creamy mascarpone filling. The top is glazed with a clear, glossy layer that subtly shows the layers beneath.  A single coffee bean is visible on the glaze. The cake should be positioned slightly off-center.  Around the cake are several fresh, ripe strawberries, arranged casually but appealingly.  Some strawberries are whole, some are slightly overlapping. They should be bright red and glossy, with visible seeds.


**Lighting:** Soft, diffused lighting should illuminate the scene evenly. Avoid harsh shadows.  The lighting should highlight the glossy texture of both the cake glaze and the strawberries, creating a subtle sheen.  A slightly warmer, yellowish white light would be preferable, suggesting soft indoor lighting.


**Style:** The overall style should be clean, elegant, and appetizing.  The image should look like a high-quality food photograph, possibly for a recipe blog or restaurant menu. The composition should feel calm and inviting. The background should be out of focus and feature a plain, light-colored surface (e.g., a wooden table or countertop) and a neutral, uncluttered background to avoid distracting from the cake and strawberries.  A hint of a plain white surface (like a table) can be visible in the extreme background, blurred significantly.


**Overall Composition:** The white plate should be centrally positioned and large enough to comfortably display the cake and strawberries. The strawberries are arranged around the cake, creating a natural and appealing border. The cake should be the focal point, slightly angled to display its layers. The aspect ratio should be approximately 3:2.  Ensure the image is sharp and detailed, emphasizing the textures of the cake and the strawberries.  The overall impression should be one of deliciousness and simple elegance.
