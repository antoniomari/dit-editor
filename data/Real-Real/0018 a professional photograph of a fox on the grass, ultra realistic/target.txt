Generate an image of a grassy field, partially shaded by a low-hanging evergreen tree. The grass is a light brownish-green, slightly patchy in texture. The tree trunk, dark brown and textured, is visible on the left side of the image.  The branches extend across a significant portion of the upper half, creating a dappled shade.


In the foreground, position a dark grey or brown rabbit, sitting upright and facing slightly to the right, near the base of the tree.  The rabbit should be detailed, showing its fur texture, long ears, and alert expression.

To the right of the rabbit, and slightly further from the viewer, place a white arctic fox.  The fox should be standing, facing the rabbit, exhibiting a neutral or slightly curious expression.  Its fur should appear fluffy and bright white. The fox should be positioned so it’s visible from the chest up to its bushy tail.  The fox’s posture should be alert but not aggressive.  The body should be realistically proportioned, with a visible tail.

The overall lighting should be soft and natural, suggestive of daytime. The interaction between the rabbit and fox is peaceful, with neither animal appearing overtly threatened or aggressive. The scene should have a somewhat whimsical, nature documentary feel. The background should be in focus, but the rabbit and fox are the central focal points.  There are a few small white flowers scattered sparsely in the grass.
