Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene. The background should depict a typical suburban backyard with a single-story house visible in the mid-ground. The house is light-colored, possibly beige or light brown, with a medium-pitched roof and several windows.  There are mature, leafy trees surrounding the house, suggesting a well-established neighborhood.  A short metal fence is partially visible in the foreground on the left side of the yard. The grass is a short, even green lawn.

In the foreground, centrally placed, is a small, fluffy white dog, specifically a Maltese or similar breed. The dog is positioned approximately in the lower-center third of the image, facing slightly to the right.  It should appear to be standing naturally on the lightly-colored, slightly bare patch of grass near the base of the lawn.  The dog should be in sharp focus, contrasting against the slightly softer focus of the background. The dog's fur should be realistically rendered with highlights and shadows to convey texture.

The overall lighting should be natural daylight, likely midday sun, casting gentle shadows on the grass and under the trees. The color palette should be natural and realistic, consistent with a bright, sunny outdoor scene.  The addition of the dog adds a touch of domesticity and warmth to the otherwise peaceful suburban scene. There should be no other significant changes to the overall scene beyond the addition of the dog.
