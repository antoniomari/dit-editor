Generate an image of a tranquil waterfront scene at sunset.Â 


**Scene:** The central focus is a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water.  The bridge is relatively low to the horizon, taking up a significant portion of the middle ground. Beyond the bridge, a cityscape is visible, featuring a prominent, tall, rectangular building (suggest a slightly Art Deco style), and other smaller buildings. The buildings are silhouetted against the sunset sky.  In the foreground is a gently sloping sandy beach, extending from the bottom of the frame towards the water. The beach is composed of dark sand or small pebbles. There is a calm, almost glassy reflection of the sky and bridge in the water. A few small boats or vessels are subtly visible near the bridge but are not the focus.


**Lighting:** The scene is bathed in the soft light of sunset. The sky displays a gradient of colors:  a warm, pinkish-orange hue near the horizon, gradually transitioning to cooler blues and purples higher up. The clouds are mostly scattered, with some areas of denser cloud cover. The overall lighting should be soft and diffused, with no harsh shadows. The buildings and bridge are silhouetted against the bright sky, emphasizing their shapes. The sand in the foreground is subtly illuminated.


**Style:** The style should be photorealistic, with a slightly muted color palette that enhances the calm and serene atmosphere.  There is a sense of stillness and tranquility; the water should be nearly perfectly smooth, showing the reflection clearly.  The overall aesthetic should be reminiscent of a high-quality landscape photograph, possibly with a slight touch of vintage or film-like grain for added character. The composition should be balanced, with the bridge as the central visual element leading the eye across the frame.


**Composition:** The image should utilize a low angle, placing the viewer close to the sand in the foreground. The horizon line should be positioned approximately one-third of the way up from the bottom edge, adhering to the rule of thirds.  Depth of field should be used to emphasize the bridge and cityscape while subtly blurring the foreground sand and background buildings. The perspective should be wide enough to capture the entirety of the scene but focused enough to maintain a sense of intimacy.
