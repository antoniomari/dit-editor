Generate an image of a student's desk setup.  The background should depict a small, cluttered desk next to a window. The desk is made of dark wood and has a small computer monitor (white Apple style) and a desk lamp (silver, gooseneck style) positioned on it. There is an open textbook illuminated by the lamp, and a partially visible wooden chair is present near the desk. The wall behind the desk features a section of patterned textile wallpaper in muted earth tones and stripes. A section of wall is visible next to the desk. The window shows a blurred exterior cityscape.


The foreground element is a tan/khaki tactical-style backpack. The backpack is strategically placed on the desk, mostly hanging off the edge towards the ground. It should appear as if it has just been casually placed there, partially obstructing the view of the desk's leg. The backpack should be in sharp focus, contrasting with the slightly softer focus of the background. The overall lighting should be soft and somewhat dim, consistent with indoor lighting.  The backpack should not appear to be digitally pasted on; rather it should be seamlessly integrated into the scene, as if it had been photographed along with the rest of the setup.
