Generate an image of a beach scene at sunset.  The background should depict a calm body of water reflecting a pastel sunset sky.  A long, multi-span bridge stretches across the water, leading to a cityscape featuring several high-rise buildings, mostly silhouetted against the evening light. The sky is a mix of soft blues, pinks, and oranges, with fluffy clouds.

In the foreground, positioned on a sandy beach slightly below the waterline, is a wirehaired dachshund partially buried in the sand.  The dog appears to be playfully interacting with a small clump of green vegetation (possibly a weed or small plant) that's draped over its head and back. The dog's fur is a light brown, contrasting with the darker sand. The overall lighting on the dog should match the ambient light of the sunset.  The scene should have a peaceful, slightly whimsical feel, with the dog as the clear focal point of the foreground against the broader city and bridge backdrop.  The dog should be slightly blurred in the background compared to the foreground.  The sand should have some texture and variations in color.
