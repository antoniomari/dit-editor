Generate an image depicting a serene waterfront scene at sunset or sunrise.

**Scene:** The focal point is a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water.  The bridge is relatively low to the horizon, appearing wide and substantial. Several smaller buildings and possibly some boats are visible near the base of the bridge on the far side of the water.  To the right, a tall, rectangular building, possibly a hotel or office building, stands prominently against the sky.  A smaller building is visible to its right. In the foreground, the viewer's perspective is from a sandy beach, the sand extending from the bottom of the frame toward the water.

**Lighting:** The sky shows a blend of colors typical of a sunset or sunrise. Pastel pinks and oranges are visible near the horizon, gradually transitioning into soft blues and purples higher up. The clouds are a mix of fluffy and streaky formations, showing some breaks in the cloud cover allowing light to filter through. The lighting should be soft and diffused, with no harsh shadows.  The bridge, buildings, and water should be subtly illuminated by the sky's light. The foreground beach should be somewhat darker than the middle ground and background.

**Style:** The overall style should be photorealistic, aiming for a high level of detail and clarity.  The image should have a slightly muted, slightly desaturated color palette to give it a calm and peaceful mood.  The water should be depicted with a subtle motion blur, suggesting a gentle current. The sand in the foreground should be finely textured, showing individual grains.  There should be a sense of depth and perspective, with the bridge and buildings receding into the distance.  The focus should be slightly sharp on the bridge, softening subtly toward the foreground and background.

**Composition:** The horizon line should be placed roughly one-third of the way up from the bottom of the frame, following the rule of thirds.  The bridge should be centered or slightly off-center, providing a sense of balance. The foreground beach occupies a significant portion of the bottom third of the image, drawing the viewer's eye towards the scene beyond.


The overall mood should be tranquil, peaceful, and slightly melancholic, evocative of a quiet evening by the water.
