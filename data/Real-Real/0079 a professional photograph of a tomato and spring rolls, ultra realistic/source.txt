Generate an image of a close-up shot of a plate of golden-brown spring rolls.  The spring rolls are arranged somewhat haphazardly, overlapping slightly, suggesting a casual, appetizing presentation.  They should have a slightly crispy texture visible, and some subtle variations in color suggesting light browning.  A small white ramekin filled with a dark brown, possibly soy-based, dipping sauce is placed near the spring rolls.  Next to the ramekin is a small garnish of shredded carrots and fresh green lettuce, adding a touch of vibrant color.


The lighting should be soft and natural, with a subtle highlight on the spring rolls to emphasize their texture.  Avoid harsh shadows. The overall style should be photorealistic, with a focus on the food's detail and appetizing quality.  The background should be slightly blurred, a creamy off-white color to complement the food, and a light brown tabletop subtly visible at the edge. The plate itself is a clean, bright white, providing a crisp contrast to the warm tones of the food. The composition should be slightly off-center, with the spring rolls as the main focus, drawing the viewer's eye to the deliciousness of the meal. The overall mood should be warm, inviting, and appetizing, suggesting a delicious and casual meal.
