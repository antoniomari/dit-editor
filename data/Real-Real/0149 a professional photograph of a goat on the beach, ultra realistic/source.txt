Generate an image of a tranquil waterfront scene at sunset. 


**Scene:** The focal point is a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water.  The bridge is fairly wide and has a straightforward design, not overly ornate. On the far side of the bridge, a city skyline is visible, dominated by a tall, rectangular building that appears to be a hotel or office building. Other buildings are present, but less prominent. The foreground consists of a sandy beach or shore, slightly textured and showing small pebbles and debris. 


**Lighting:** The lighting should evoke a sunset scene.  The sky should be a blend of muted pastel colours—pale oranges, yellows, and pinks near the horizon, gradually transitioning to deeper blues and purples higher up. The clouds should be a mixture of thin, wispy clouds and thicker, more dramatic cumulus clouds. The overall light should be soft and diffuse, with no harsh shadows. The sun itself should be below the horizon, its light reflected on the water and slightly illuminating the city skyline. The bridge should be silhouetted against the sky.


**Style:** The style should be photorealistic, with a slightly muted or desaturated color palette to create a calm and peaceful mood. The image should have a cinematic feel, similar to a landscape photograph, possibly with a long exposure to create a slightly blurred effect on the water, suggesting movement. The overall composition should be balanced, with the bridge as a central element leading the eye into the city skyline.


**Composition:** The perspective should be from a low vantage point, near the water's edge, looking across the water towards the bridge and the city. The foreground beach should occupy approximately the lower third of the frame, the water the middle third, and the bridge and skyline the upper third.  The horizon line should be approximately one-third of the way up from the bottom of the image.


The overall feeling should be one of serenity and quiet beauty, evoking a sense of calm and peace.
