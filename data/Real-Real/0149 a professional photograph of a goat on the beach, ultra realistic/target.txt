Generate an image of a serene waterfront scene at sunset. The background should depict a wide river, a long bridge spanning the width of the image, and a cityscape featuring tall buildings, primarily a large, rectangular hotel-like structure on the right side. The sky should be a mixture of soft pastel oranges and pinks from the setting sun, with cooler blues and grays in the clouds, creating a dramatic yet peaceful atmosphere. The water should be relatively calm, reflecting the colors of the sky and the city lights.

In the foreground, place a single, fluffy white goat standing on a sandy beach. The goat is centrally positioned, and it appears calm and peaceful. Its fur should be realistically textured, with subtle highlights to show the softness of its coat.  The goat should be slightly off-center, closer to the lower left.  The goat is facing slightly to the left. It's a relatively large goat, taking up a significant portion of the foreground.

The goat should appear naturally placed in the scene, as if it has simply wandered onto the beach. There should be no visible editing artifacts, such as a sharp contrast between the goat and its surroundings. The ground should be a mix of light sand and small pebbles, consistent with a beach or riverbank. The goat should not be interacting with the bridge or buildings; its focus should be on the viewer or the serene landscape. The overall impact should be a juxtaposition of the urban landscape and the unexpected presence of the serene, peaceful goat, resulting in a humorous and slightly surreal image.
