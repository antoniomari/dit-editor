Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene on a slightly overcast day.  The style should be photorealistic, with a focus on natural lighting and subtle color variations.

The scene is dominated by a large, neatly mown lawn of a medium-green hue.  This lawn occupies the majority of the foreground and midground. The foreground itself features a strip of light brown, sandy soil with sparse, small green weeds.

In the midground, a modest, single-story house is visible. The house is light brown or beige, with a standard gable roof. It appears to be made of wood or vinyl siding.  Its windows are relatively small and unobtrusive. A section of a wooden fence runs along the back of the house. Partially obscured by trees to the left, a smaller structure or perhaps a shed, is visible behind a chain-link fence which also runs along the left side of the yard.

The background is filled with mature, leafy deciduous trees of various sizes. These trees are predominantly green, with subtle variations in shade, suggesting a mix of tree species. The trees create a sense of depth and enclosure, surrounding the house and yard. The leaves are not dense enough to create deep shade, allowing for a soft, diffuse light to illuminate the scene.

The overall composition is a wide shot, emphasizing the expanse of the lawn and the feeling of space within the suburban setting. The lighting should be soft and natural, with no harsh shadows. The overall color palette should be muted and realistic, reflecting the subdued light of a mostly cloudy day. There should be a slight haze or softness to the image to enhance realism.  No people should be clearly visible, but possibly an indistinct suggestion of a person or object near the back of the house.
