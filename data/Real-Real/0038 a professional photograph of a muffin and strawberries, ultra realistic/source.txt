Generate a photorealistic image of a slice of tiramisu cake on a white plate, surrounded by fresh strawberries.

**Scene:**  The main focus is a single, generous slice of tiramisu cake.  The cake should have two distinct layers of coffee-soaked ladyfingers visible beneath a creamy, possibly mascarpone-based filling. The top is glazed with a clear, glossy layer, showing a slightly darker coffee-colored layer beneath.  A single dark coffee bean or chocolate garnish is visible on the top. The cake should appear moist and decadent. Several whole strawberries are arranged artfully around the cake slice on a plain white rectangular plate. The strawberries should be ripe and glossy, with a deep red hue and visible seeds.

**Lighting:** The lighting should be soft and diffused, avoiding harsh shadows. Aim for a warm, slightly subdued lighting that enhances the rich colors of the cake and strawberries without washing them out. A slight highlight should accentuate the glaze on the cake and the sheen of the strawberries.

**Style:** The overall style should be clean, simple, and elegant. The image should have a sophisticated and appetizing feel, conveying a sense of calm and deliciousness. The composition should be carefully arranged to create a visually pleasing and balanced image.  The background should be very simple, perhaps a neutral off-white or light beige, essentially uncluttered and out of focus, drawing all the attention to the food.

**Composition:** The cake slice is positioned slightly off-center, creating a more dynamic composition.  The strawberries are carefully arranged around the cake, with some partially overlapping each other, creating a natural, slightly asymmetrical arrangement, avoiding a perfectly ordered pattern. The plate is a simple, clean white, providing a crisp contrast to the warm colors of the cake and strawberries.


The overall image should evoke a feeling of indulgence and a desire to eat the cake and strawberries. The level of detail should be high enough to show the texture of the cake layers, the glossy sheen of the glaze, and the individual seeds of the strawberries.  The focus should be sharply on the cake and strawberries, with the background smoothly blurred.
