Generate a landscape image in a photorealistic style. The scene is a gently sloping hillside, predominantly covered in various shades of green grasses and wildflowers.  A barely visible, light dirt path meanders from the midground towards the viewer, subtly curving to the right.

The path cuts through a field that transitions from a slightly taller, wilder growth of grass closer to the hilltop, gradually becoming shorter and more manicured as it approaches the foreground.  Scattered patches of wildflowers, predominantly yellow and small in scale, add pops of color throughout the field, particularly concentrated along the sides of the path and in the foreground.

In the background, a line of low-lying deciduous trees and shrubs forms a natural border between the hillside and a denser forest of evergreens. The evergreens are darker and more saturated green, creating a contrast with the lighter hues of the hillside and wildflowers. The trees are mostly soft-edged, suggesting a slight atmospheric haze.

The lighting should be soft and diffused, indicative of an overcast day or soft sunlight filtering through a light cloud cover. There should be no harsh shadows.  The overall color palette should be muted and natural, with greens, yellows, and browns predominating.  The light should be brighter in the foreground and gradually soften in intensity as it recedes into the background, creating a sense of depth. The overall composition should be tranquil and peaceful, evoking a feeling of serenity and natural beauty.  The image should be relatively high-resolution, capable of showing the fine detail of the grasses and wildflowers.
