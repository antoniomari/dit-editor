Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene with a large, light-colored tiger lying in the grass.  The background should depict a typical suburban landscape, including:

* **Background:** A green lawn, relatively short-clipped grass, some patchy bare dirt near the viewer.  Several large, mature deciduous trees, creating dappled shade, are spread across the background.  There is a single-story house visible in the mid-ground, light-colored with dark roofing.  The house appears to be somewhat older style architecture with visible gables. A chain-link fence runs along the left and back edge of the yard, partially obscuring some additional landscaping elements (shrubs/ bushes).  The overall lighting should suggest a partly cloudy day; slightly diffused but not harshly dark.


* **Foreground:** A large, adult tiger, mostly pale/light colored with distinct dark stripes. The tiger's fur should appear soft and somewhat reflective in the light. The tiger is lying down, relaxed, and not aggressively positioned. Its head should be slightly lowered, perhaps looking towards something to the ground.  The tiger should be placed slightly off-center, perhaps towards the middle-right of the frame.


* **Interaction:** The tiger is simply lying on the grass, seemingly at rest.  Its presence is the primary change to the background scene; it's an unexpected element in this ordinary backyard.  The grass under the tiger should show slight compression but not significant displacement.  There should be no other animals or people visible. The tiger should be in focus, and its details sharply rendered.


The overall style should be photorealistic, aiming for a believable composite image. The lighting and shadowing of the tiger must be consistent with the lighting of the rest of the scene.  The goal is to create a surprising but subtly blended juxtaposition of a wild animal in a domesticated setting.
