Generate an image depicting a tranquil waterfront scene at sunset. 


**Scene:** The main focus is a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water. The bridge has a flat, slightly elevated deck supported by numerous pillars.  Beyond the bridge, a cityscape is visible, featuring a prominent, tall, rectangular building (possibly a hotel or office building) and other smaller structures. The cityscape appears slightly muted in color, as if it’s in the distance. The foreground is dominated by a sandy beach or shoreline, extending from the bottom of the image to the water's edge.


**Lighting:** The lighting is that of a sunset or sunrise. The sky features a blend of muted warm tones (yellows, oranges, and pinks) near the horizon and cooler blues and greys higher up. The light is soft and diffused, casting no harsh shadows. The bridge and city are silhouetted against the sky, highlighting their shapes against the brighter backdrop. A slight reflection of the sky and bridge can be seen on the calm water.


**Style:** The overall style should be photorealistic, with a focus on capturing a peaceful and serene atmosphere. The image should have a slightly muted color palette, leaning towards a more naturalistic and understated feel.  The water should appear smooth, almost glassy, conveying stillness.  The depth of field should be such that the foreground (the beach) is sharpest, with the bridge and city slightly softer but still easily discernible. The overall composition aims for a calm and expansive feel.


**Composition:**  The image should be composed in a horizontal orientation. The foreground beach takes up a significant portion of the lower third of the image, leading the eye towards the bridge and the city in the middle ground and background. The bridge should be centrally located, creating a strong visual anchor.  The sky should occupy a significant portion of the upper part of the image, creating a sense of spaciousness. The arrangement should aim for a balanced yet naturally appealing composition.
