Generate an image of a tranquil waterfront scene at either dawn or dusk. 


**Scene:** The focal point is a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water. The bridge is relatively low to the horizon, and has a flat, simple design. Beyond the bridge, a cityscape is visible, featuring a few high-rise buildings, the tallest of which is a rectangular, dark-colored structure.  The city skyline is relatively low, not overly dense. In the foreground, a sandy beach or shoreline extends from the bottom edge, taking up roughly a third of the frame. The sand is coarse-grained and appears dark in color due to the low light.


**Lighting:** The light is soft and diffused, characteristic of either early morning or late evening. The sky displays a beautiful blend of colors, ranging from soft pinks and oranges near the horizon to deeper blues and purples higher up. The clouds are voluminous and spread across most of the sky, contributing to the atmospheric quality. The overall lighting should create a calm and serene atmosphere.  The bridge and cityscape are subtly silhouetted against the sky.


**Style:** The style should be photorealistic, striving for a high level of detail and realism. The image should have a slightly muted or desaturated color palette, enhancing the moody and peaceful feeling. The overall composition emphasizes the horizontal lines of the bridge, water, and shoreline, creating a sense of calmness and expanse.  Long exposure effects are desired; the water should have a slightly blurred, smooth appearance, enhancing its tranquility.


**Composition:** Use the rule of thirds to place the bridge slightly off-center. The shoreline in the foreground should lead the viewer's eye towards the bridge and city in the background.  The sky should occupy a significant portion of the upper two-thirds of the image, emphasizing the dramatic sky. The overall aspect ratio can be standard landscape orientation.
