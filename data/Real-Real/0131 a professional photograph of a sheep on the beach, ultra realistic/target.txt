Generate an image of a beach scene at sunset.  The background should depict a cityscape with a long, multi-span bridge stretching across a wide body of water. The sky should be a mix of soft pastel colors at the horizon (pinks, oranges, and yellows) gradually transitioning to deeper blues and purples overhead.  The clouds should be fluffy and somewhat dramatic, suggesting a sunset.

In the foreground, a single, fluffy white sheep is positioned on a gravelly beach, facing left and slightly angled away from the viewer. The sheep appears to be grazing peacefully. It should be placed slightly off-center, lower in the frame, closer to the left side. The gravelly beach should extend from the water's edge up to where the sheep is, forming a natural transition between the water and the land.  The water should be relatively calm, reflecting the sky and the city skyline somewhat.

The sheep should be realistically rendered, with its wool appearing soft and textured.  The overall lighting of the image should be consistent with the sunset, casting a warm, slightly soft light on the scene. The juxtaposition of the peaceful sheep with the urban background creates a surreal and slightly humorous contrast.  The scale of the sheep should be realistic relative to the background cityscape, not overly large or small. The overall feeling should be serene but slightly unexpected.
