Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene.  The background should consist of a neatly mown lawn, a single-story house with a light brown facade, and several mature, leafy trees.  A short chain-link fence is visible in the foreground. The house should appear modest, possibly with a slightly gabled roof and some visible windows. The trees should provide ample shade, with their branches reaching across most of the backyard.  The overall lighting should suggest a sunny day, but with the shade of the trees softening the light in some areas.

In the foreground, superimpose a giant panda bear lying sprawled on the lawn. The panda should be positioned roughly in the lower center of the image, mostly on the lawn but with a small portion appearing to be lying in a slightly muddy or sandy patch of earth.  The panda should appear relaxed and peaceful, possibly slightly spread out. Its fur should be realistically rendered, with the distinctive black and white markings clearly visible.  The panda's pose should convey a sense of contentment.

The overall effect should be a humorous juxtaposition of the unexpected presence of a giant panda in a typical suburban setting. The panda shouldn't appear distressed or unnatural; instead, it should blend into the scene in a surreal and entertaining way, with the scale of the panda dramatically impacting the size of the elements of the house and yard. The contrast between the mundane backyard and the extraordinary panda is key to the image's impact.  Maintain realistic shadows for both the panda and the elements of the backyard.
