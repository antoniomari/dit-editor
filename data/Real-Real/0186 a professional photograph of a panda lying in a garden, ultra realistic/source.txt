Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene on an overcast day.  The style should be photorealistic, with a slightly muted color palette.

The main focus is a large, mostly flat lawn of bright, slightly uneven green grass. This lawn occupies the majority of the foreground and middle ground.  The grass is relatively short, with a few sparse patches of lighter color possibly indicating dry spots or sandy soil peeking through. The ground in the immediate foreground is a mix of sand and sparse, short grass, creating a slightly rough texture.


In the mid-ground, behind the lawn, is a single-story house with a dark brown or gray roof and light-colored siding. The house appears to be a simple ranch style with several windows visible.  It's not overly detailed; it's more of a background element than the focus. To the left of the main house, a portion of another house or structure is visible behind a fence.


The background is filled with mature, leafy deciduous trees, mainly green with some lighter greens indicating new growth. The trees are of various heights and create a somewhat dense but not overly cluttered backdrop. The trees are spaced enough that there is some sky visible between them, but itâ€™s mostly overcast, so the sky is a light, even gray without harsh shadows.


A chain-link fence is partially visible, separating the lawn from the immediate surroundings to the left and behind the house. A partially visible dark-green object, possibly a shed or storage unit, is situated behind the fence to the left of the main house.


The lighting is soft and diffused, consistent with an overcast day.  There are no harsh shadows; the overall lighting is even across the scene, avoiding strong contrasts. The overall composition is a wide shot, emphasizing the expanse of the lawn and the relatively calm suburban setting. The image should have a calm, peaceful atmosphere.
