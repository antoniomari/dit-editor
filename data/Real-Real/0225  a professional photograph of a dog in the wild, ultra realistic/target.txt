Generate an image of a gently sloping grassy hillside, reminiscent of a pastoral scene.  The hillside is predominantly green, with patches of yellow wildflowers scattered throughout the foreground and mid-ground.Â  The background consists of a dark green line of evergreen trees on a higher elevation, creating a natural boundary. A light dirt path meanders from the middle-ground towards the viewer. The path appears well-worn but not heavily used.

In the mid-ground, slightly off-center, place a fluffy white Bichon Frise dog. The dog should be facing the viewer, appearing somewhat pensive or calm.  It should be small in scale relative to the overall scene, but clearly visible. The dog seems to be standing slightly on the edge of the path, with a small amount of greenery immediately around it that blends in to the hillside.  The overall lighting should be bright and sunny, casting a natural light on the scene. The color palette should be predominantly greens and yellows, with the white of the dog providing a clear contrast. The addition of the dog should not drastically alter the natural feel of the background, but rather introduce a focal point that is calmly integrated into the natural scene.
