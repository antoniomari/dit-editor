Generate an image of a sesame seed hamburger, positioned slightly off-center and toward the bottom of the frame. The hamburger should appear as if it's been digitally added to the scene, not seamlessly integrated.  The burger should have a juicy appearance, with visible lettuce, tomato, and cheese, and a slightly messy look, indicating it is freshly made. The bun should be golden brown with a generous sprinkling of sesame seeds.

The background consists of a white plate with several spring rolls arranged in a slightly haphazard pile.  Three to four spring rolls should be clearly visible, light brown in color and slightly crispy looking, with some showing their edges.   A small white ramekin filled with a dark reddish-brown sauce (presumably soy sauce or a similar dipping sauce) sits nestled amongst the spring rolls and a garnish of shredded carrots and lettuce is partially visible in the upper left corner.

The spring rolls and sauce appear slightly out of focus compared to the sharply focused hamburger, further emphasizing the digitally added nature of the burger.  The burger itself slightly overlaps some of the spring rolls.  The overall lighting should be bright and even, characteristic of food photography.  The background plate and table setting should be clean and uncluttered, the scene reflecting a casual yet appealing restaurant setting. The background image should maintain its original quality and should not be changed to match the burger's lighting or style.
