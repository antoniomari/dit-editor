Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene on a slightly overcast day.  The style should be photorealistic, with a focus on natural light and accurate color representation.

**Scene:** The main focus is a large, expansive lawn of a light to medium green, slightly uneven in texture.  In the background, a one-story ranch-style house is visible. The house is light brown or beige with a dark brown roof.  It's partially obscured by mature deciduous trees that are mostly in full leaf, suggesting spring or early summer.  There's a chain-link fence partially visible in the foreground, separating the lawn from what appears to be a slightly sandy or dry area in the immediate foreground, possibly a driveway or path.  A smaller structure, perhaps a shed or storage unit, is visible behind a portion of the fence, to the left of the main house.

**Lighting:** The lighting should be soft and diffused, indicative of an overcast day.  There are no harsh shadows; the light is even across the scene. The overall color palette is muted and natural, with greens, browns, and grays dominating.

**Composition:** The image should be a wide shot, emphasizing the vastness of the lawn and the depth created by the trees and house in the background. The viewpoint is from a slightly lower angle, looking up towards the house and trees. The foreground sandy/dry area should take up roughly the bottom quarter of the image.


**Additional details:**

* The trees are a mixture of sizes and species, with varying shades of green leaves.
* The grass is slightly longer in some areas than others.
* The overall feeling should be one of calm and quiet suburban tranquility.
* Avoid any overly saturated or unrealistic colors. Aim for a natural and slightly muted palette.
* The house should appear lived-in but not cluttered; it should be a simple, unassuming dwelling.
* Include some small details like sparse vegetation around the house and possibly a few small objects or toys in the backyard near the fence (but don't make this the focus).


The goal is a realistic representation of a typical suburban backyard, emphasizing the natural elements and the sense of space and calm.
