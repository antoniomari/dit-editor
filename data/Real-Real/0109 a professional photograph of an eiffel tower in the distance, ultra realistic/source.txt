Generate an image of a whimsical, slightly surreal scene featuring a fluffy, light beige teddy bear positioned in the foreground, slightly off-center to the left.  The bear is looking towards the viewer, its face is soft and friendly with a stitched brown nose and mouth. Its fur should be realistically textured, appearing soft and slightly plush.

The background features a long, straight asphalt road stretching into the distance towards a rural landscape under a bright, sunny sky.  The road is relatively empty, with perhaps a single small vehicle barely visible in the far distance.  The sky is a clear, vibrant blue with scattered, fluffy white clouds, suggesting a daytime setting with abundant natural light.

The road is bordered by grassy verges, and beyond that, a field of tall, dry-looking corn stalks stretches to the horizon. In the far distance, low rolling hills are visible, suggesting a flat, open landscape.  The overall color palette should be warm and inviting, with the bright yellows and greens of the landscape contrasting nicely with the cool blues of the sky.

The style should be photorealistic, with a slightly heightened saturation to emphasize the vibrancy of the colors.  The lighting should be natural, with the sun appearing high in the sky, casting soft shadows and illuminating the scene evenly. The composition should create a sense of depth and perspective, drawing the viewer's eye along the road towards the distant hills. The overall feel should be idyllic and peaceful, with a touch of whimsy added by the presence of the teddy bear in the foreground. The image should have a wide angle of view, encompassing the entire scene from the bear to the distant horizon.
