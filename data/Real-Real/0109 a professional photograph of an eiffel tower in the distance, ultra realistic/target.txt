Generate an image of a long, straight, two-lane asphalt road stretching into the distance under a mostly sunny sky with some fluffy white clouds. On either side of the road is short, grassy vegetation.  To the left of the road, a field of tall, dry corn stalks is visible.  In the far distance, low rolling hills are visible under the sky.


In the foreground, a light beige plush teddy bear occupies the bottom left corner.  The bear is facing the viewer, slightly turned toward the right, with its head and upper body visible. The bear's expression is friendly and slightly curious.


Superimposed into the background, approximately in the mid-ground and positioned slightly off-center to the left of the road, is a miniature replica of the Eiffel Tower. The Eiffel Tower is rendered in a muted steel gray color, and it is somewhat smaller in scale than what you'd expect in a real-world setting to match the scale of the rest of the scene and the teddy bear. The placement suggests that the bear is seemingly close to the Eiffel Tower as if they're on a road trip together. There should be no blending or realistic shadow integration with the Eiffel Tower and its environment. It's purely placed there as a composite element.

The overall scene is a surreal juxtaposition of a rural Australian or similar landscape with the iconic Parisian landmark. The style should be photorealistic except for the deliberate incongruity of the Eiffel Towerâ€™s location and size within the scene and the artistic license taken in its composition. The lighting should be consistent throughout the image, maintaining the natural lighting of the background scene.
