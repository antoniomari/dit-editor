Generate an image of a serene waterfront scene at sunset or sunrise.  The style should be photorealistic with a slightly muted, almost melancholic color palette.  The focus is on a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water.

**Scene:** The bridge is the central element, extending across most of the width of the frame.  It's a relatively flat, multi-span bridge with evenly spaced supports.  To the right, a tall, somewhat blocky building, possibly a hotel or office building, stands out against the skyline.  Other buildings are visible in the distance but are less prominent.  In the foreground, there's a sandy beach, coarse in texture, extending from the bottom of the frame towards the water. The water is relatively calm, reflecting the sky and bridge. A few small boats or vessels may be subtly visible near the bridge.

**Lighting:** The lighting is soft and diffused, characteristic of the golden hour around sunset or sunrise.  The sky is a mixture of soft blues, grays, and subtle pinkish hues in the area where the sun is below the horizon, with some lighter clouds.  The overall light is not harsh; it's gentle and evenly distributed. The bridge and buildings are silhouetted, appearing dark against the lighter sky.  There is a slight reflection of the sky and bridge on the water's surface.

**Style:** The overall style should be photorealistic, capturing the detail and texture of the sand, water, and structures.  The color grading should aim for a subdued, slightly desaturated look.  Slight motion blur on the water's surface would enhance the serene atmosphere.  The image should feel peaceful and contemplative.

**Composition:** The perspective should be from a low vantage point, near the water's edge, giving a sense of being close to the sand and looking across the water toward the bridge and city. The bridge should dominate the midground, with the beach in the foreground and the cityscape in the background. The rule of thirds can be followed for a balanced composition.
