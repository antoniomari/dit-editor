Generate an image depicting a serene waterfront scene at sunset.  The background should feature a long, modern bridge spanning a wide river.  The bridge is a muted grey-blue, with various support structures visible. Beyond the bridge, a cityscape is visible, dominated by a tall, rectangular building—slightly darker than the sky— that hints at a downtown area.  The sky should be a vibrant blend of pastel sunset colors (pinks, oranges, and yellows) blending into dusky blues and greys towards the upper portion of the frame. Clouds should be present, fluffy and somewhat dramatic but not obscuring the cityscape or bridge. The river itself should be calm, with subtle reflections of the sky and city. The shoreline appears as a dark-grey, pebbly beach.


The foreground element is a giant panda, realistically rendered, sitting on this beach.  The panda is positioned slightly off-center, closer to the left side of the image. It is sitting and appearing to eat from a clump of vibrant green bamboo shoots. The bamboo is at its feet and partially obscures the ground. The panda should appear relaxed and at peace within its environment. Its fur should have a realistic texture and shading.  There should be no visible harsh edges between the panda and the background, suggesting a seamless integration. The overall lighting should be consistent between the panda and the background, creating a believable composite image. The scene should convey a sense of calm and unexpected juxtaposition—a peaceful panda in an unexpected urban setting.
