Generate a photorealistic image of a living room scene. The room features a predominantly light color scheme.  One wall is painted a vibrant teal or turquoise, providing a strong color contrast. The other walls are a warm, creamy off-white or pale yellow.

The flooring is highly polished, wide-plank hardwood, likely pine or a similar wood species, exhibiting a rich, honey-gold tone.  The planks run horizontally across the frame. The floor shows some subtle variations in color and texture, indicating natural wood grain and slight wear. The wood is highly reflective, showing some shine from a light source.

The furniture consists of two beige or off-white upholstered sofas; a smaller, two-seater couch and a larger section that could be a loveseat or sofa. The sofas are simple in design, with slightly rounded arms and neutral, light beige upholstery that appears soft and plush.  They are placed at a slight angle to each other.

Between the sofas sits an oval or slightly rectangular dark wood coffee table with elegant, curved legs.  A single dark blue glass bottle and a small, light green flowering plant are arranged as a centerpiece on the table.

The room includes two windows with warm-toned wood frames; one is visible in the background, showcasing a bright, natural light source.  The windows are covered with sheer, light-yellow or beige curtains, letting in soft light but maintaining some privacy.  The curtains are fairly simple and unadorned.  A glimpse of a doorway to another room with purple walls is visible at the far left, adding depth.

The overall lighting is soft and natural, suggesting daytime illumination with light coming primarily from the window(s). There are no harsh shadows; the image has a calm and serene atmosphere. The style is simple, rustic, or possibly farmhouse, focusing on clean lines and natural materials.  The composition is balanced, with the furniture arranged to create a comfortable seating area and the strong teal wall serving as a visual focal point. The perspective is from a slightly elevated viewpoint, creating a view of the scene as someone might see it walking into the room.
