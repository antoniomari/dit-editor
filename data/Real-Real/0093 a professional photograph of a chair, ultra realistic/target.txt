Generate an image of a living room with hardwood floors.  The walls are a two-toned color scheme: a teal blue on one wall and a pale yellow-cream on the adjacent walls. A beige loveseat is positioned against the teal wall.  The loveseat has three beige throw pillows. In front of the loveseat is a dark brown, four-legged coffee table with a glass top.  A small green flowering plant and a dark blue bottle are placed as a centerpiece on the coffee table.  

A coral or peach colored armchair is positioned in the lower right quadrant of the image, angled slightly away from the loveseat and coffee table.  The armchair is positioned in the creamy yellow-toned part of the room.  The overall lighting should be soft and natural, suggesting daylight coming from the window. The floor is a light-medium brown hardwood, showing the wood grain clearly.  A portion of an off-white sofa is visible in the bottom left corner of the image, suggesting that the image has been cropped, or that it is just a portion of a larger room.   The window in the image features a beige curtain. The door to the left is partially open, with a small portion of a purple wall and a checkered floor peeking through.  The style should be realistic and slightly homely.
