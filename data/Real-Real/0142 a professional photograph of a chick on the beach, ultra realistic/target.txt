Generate an image of a cityscape at sunset with a small yellow duckling in the foreground.

**Background:** The background should depict a cityscape at sunset.  A long bridge spans a body of water, with several buildings visible on the far shore.  The most prominent building is a tall, rectangular high-rise, possibly a hotel or office building.  Other buildings are shorter and less defined.  The sky is a dramatic mix of sunset colors (oranges, pinks, and purples) blending into blues and grays.  The water is relatively calm, reflecting the sky and the city lights subtly. The overall mood should be serene but slightly dramatic due to the colors of the sunset.

**Foreground:** In the foreground, place a single, fluffy yellow duckling. It should be positioned slightly off-center, about one-third of the way up from the bottom edge of the frame. The duckling should be facing to the right of the frame, appearing small and somewhat lonely against the vast background.  The duckling should be realistically rendered, with details such as its soft downy feathers visible.

**Interaction:** The duckling should be positioned on a dark gray-brown sandy shore, which is slightly blurred to focus attention on the duckling.  The sand should appear wet in places. There should be a clear contrast between the tiny duckling and the immense scale of the cityscape. The duckling should appear as if it is all alone on this beach near the city, giving the viewer a feeling of vastness and solitude. No other elements should distract from the duckling's prominent placement.

**Overall changes:** The addition of the duckling significantly alters the scale and mood of the original background image. The large cityscape is contrasted by the tiny creature, creating a feeling of contrast and perhaps even a touch of melancholy.  The image should retain the sunset's dramatic beauty while emphasizing the small, seemingly insignificant duckling in the foreground. The overall tone should be peaceful yet thought-provoking.
