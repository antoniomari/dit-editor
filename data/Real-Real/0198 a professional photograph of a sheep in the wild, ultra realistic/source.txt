Generate a landscape image in a photorealistic style.  The scene is a gently sloping hillside, predominantly covered in tall, light-green grass. A dirt path winds its way from the lower right corner, upwards and slightly left towards the middle ground.

The path is lightly colored, with patches of tan and brown dirt visible, and the grass flanking it is a bit shorter and more uniformly green.  To the left of the path, the grass is taller, more varied in shades of green and yellow, showing a slightly more wild, less manicured appearance.  Wildflowers are sparsely scattered throughout the grass, predominantly yellow in hue, with small touches of red/orange in some areas in the lower left corner.

In the middle ground,  a small copse of reddish-brown deciduous trees stands out against the brighter greenery, creating a natural focal point.  Behind this copse, the hillside continues upwards into a densely wooded area.

The upper background consists of a hill densely covered with dark green coniferous trees, creating a lush backdrop. The trees are somewhat out of focus, softly blurring into the background, suggesting depth and distance.

The lighting is soft and diffuse, suggesting an overcast day or soft sunlight filtering through a light canopy. The overall color palette is muted and natural, with greens and yellows dominating, and soft browns in the earth and the trees. There's a light haze or ethereal quality to the atmosphere, softening the details and giving it a slightly dreamy feel.  The image should have a natural depth of field, with the middle ground and path in sharper focus than the distant trees. The overall composition should feel peaceful and tranquil, capturing the essence of a rural, unblemished landscape.
