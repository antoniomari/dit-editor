Generate an image of a gently sloping hillside covered in lush green grass and wildflowers.  The hillside is dotted with small, deciduous trees and a larger forest of evergreens is visible in the background, creating a sense of depth.  A well-worn, light-brown dirt path winds its way up the hill from the lower-right corner towards the center of the image, then disappearing behind a cluster of shrubs. The overall lighting is soft and natural, indicative of a sunny day.

In the mid-ground, positioned slightly off-center to the left of the path, is a single, large grey sheep.  The sheep is facing forward, but slightly angled towards the viewer, giving a three-quarter view. Its fleece is thick and slightly uneven, with a hint of mauve or pinkish tinge to some parts of its coat.  The sheep appears calm and placid, blending somewhat with the surrounding flora, but remaining distinct and clearly visible against the lighter green grass. The sheep is not interacting physically with any other element in the scene but adds a focal point to the otherwise naturally pastoral scene. The foreground grass around the sheep contains yellow wildflowers interspersed throughout the predominantly green grass.  The addition of the sheep introduces a domestic and slightly whimsical element to a previously purely natural landscape.
