Generate a photorealistic image of a slice of tiramisu cake on a white plate, surrounded by fresh strawberries.

**Scene:** The scene is a close-up shot of a single slice of tiramisu cake elegantly placed on a clean white rectangular plate.  The cake is the focal point, with several fresh, ripe strawberries arranged artfully around it.  The strawberries are positioned in a slightly asymmetrical pattern, not perfectly spaced, adding a natural, unforced feel.  The background is a softly blurred, out-of-focus light beige or off-white wall, creating a minimalist backdrop that focuses attention on the food. A hint of a patterned white ceramic item (possibly a mug or vase) is visible in the upper right corner, extremely out of focus.

**Lighting:** The lighting is soft and diffused, avoiding harsh shadows.  The light source seems to be from above, illuminating the cake and strawberries evenly without causing glare or extreme highlights.  The overall lighting scheme is warm and inviting, enhancing the appetizing appearance of the food.

**Style:** The style is clean, simple, and sophisticated. The image should have a natural, unpretentious feel, avoiding overly stylized or artificial effects.  The overall aesthetic is reminiscent of high-quality food photography.

**Cake Details:** The tiramisu slice is meticulously rendered. The layers are clearly visible: a bottom layer of coffee-soaked ladyfingers, a thick layer of creamy mascarpone filling, and a top layer of coffee-soaked ladyfingers, which are capped with a thin layer of clear, glossy glaze. A small coffee bean sits decoratively on the glaze. The texture of the mascarpone appears smooth and creamy, while the ladyfingers have a slightly porous texture.

**Strawberry Details:**  The strawberries are plump, red, and glossy, exhibiting realistic highlights and subtle shadows.  Their texture should be visibleâ€”slightly bumpy and slightly shiny.

**Composition:** The cake is centrally located but slightly off-center, creating a visually pleasing asymmetry.  The strawberries are strategically placed to complement the cake and the plate's shape, leading the viewer's eye around the image. The overall composition is balanced and avoids any feeling of emptiness or crowding. The white plate provides a clean contrast to the warm tones of the cake and strawberries.

**Overall:** The image should be sharp and detailed, with a shallow depth of field, making the cake and strawberries stand out from the slightly blurred background.  The overall impression should be one of appetizing deliciousness and visual elegance.
