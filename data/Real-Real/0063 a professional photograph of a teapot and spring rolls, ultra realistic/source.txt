Generate an image of a close-up shot of a plate of golden-brown spring rolls arranged artfully on a bright white plate.  The spring rolls should be slightly oily and glistening, showing a crisp texture.  They should vary slightly in size and position, creating a sense of casual abundance rather than rigid symmetry.

In the upper left corner, a small garnish of shredded carrots and fresh green lettuce provides a contrasting color and texture.  A small, simple white ramekin sits nestled amongst the spring rolls and garnish, containing a dark reddish-brown dipping sauce that reflects the ambient light.  The sauce should be glossy and slightly translucent, suggesting a savory consistency.

The lighting should be soft and diffused, avoiding harsh shadows and emphasizing the warm tones of the spring rolls and the sauce. The overall style should be clean, bright, and appetizing, mimicking high-quality food photography. The background should be subtly blurred and out of focus, drawing the viewer's eye to the spring rolls and the plate itself.  The plate itself should be slightly curved and modern in design. The overall composition should be slightly off-center, creating a more natural and less posed look. The focus should be sharpest on the spring rolls in the middle of the plate.
