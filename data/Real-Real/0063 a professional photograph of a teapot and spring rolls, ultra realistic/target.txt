Generate an image of a plate of golden-brown spring rolls arranged somewhat haphazardly.  The rolls are slightly irregular in shape and size, with some appearing crispier than others.  They are positioned in a slightly overlapping manner, creating a visually interesting pile.

In the center of the plate, slightly above and behind the spring rolls, is a small, pale pink teapot. The teapot is positioned as though it contains a dipping sauce for the spring rolls. It’s a simple, slightly rounded design with a small lid and a curved handle and spout. The teapot's color is a pastel pink, not a bright pink. The teapot appears to be slightly translucent, and shows a hint of a darker shade underneath, as if light is passing through it.  The teapot is not perfectly centered but is offset slightly to the left.

In the background, partially visible under the teapot and to the left, is a small portion of a side dish – a garnish consisting of shredded carrots and a few leaves of light green lettuce. This garnish is slightly blurred compared to the sharper focus on the spring rolls and teapot.  The plate itself is simple and white, providing a clean contrast to the warm tones of the spring rolls.  The overall lighting is soft and natural, enhancing the warm colors and textures of the food.  The image should have a shallow depth of field, with the spring rolls and teapot in sharp focus, and the background slightly blurred.
