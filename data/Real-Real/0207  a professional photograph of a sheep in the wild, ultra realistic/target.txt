Generate an image of a pastoral scene.  The background should depict a gently sloping hillside, covered in lush green grass. The hillside is dotted with various shades of green shrubs and trees, creating a textured, natural look.  A faint dirt path meanders through the center of the scene towards the background.  The trees are mainly evergreen, with some deciduous trees showing a mix of greens and yellows.  The overall lighting is bright and natural, suggesting a sunny day.


In the foreground, position a single, light-beige or off-white sheep.  The sheep should be positioned slightly off-center, near the left side of the dirt path, grazing on the grass.  It should appear life-sized relative to the background, approximately in the middle ground.  The sheep's wool should be relatively short and smooth, and its posture should be natural and relaxed, indicative of a grazing animal. Its head should be lowered towards the ground, as if it's eating grass.


The sheep should be seamlessly integrated into the background, without any visible harsh edges or artifacts.  The grass around the sheep should appear slightly disturbed from its grazing.  There should be a sense of depth and continuity between the foreground and background elements. The overall feeling should be peaceful, serene, and idyllic, suggesting a quiet moment in a rural setting.  Include some small yellow wildflowers around the sheep and near the path, adding to the overall pastoral quality.
