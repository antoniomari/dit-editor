Generate an image of a grassy hillside scene with a dirt path meandering through it.  The hillside is lush green, with patches of wildflowers, primarily yellow, scattered throughout. The background shows a dense forest of evergreen trees at the top of the hill, creating a natural border.  The path is light brownish-tan, with some visible small rocks and pebbles. The overall lighting suggests a sunny day.

In the foreground, slightly to the left of the center of the path, place a border collie puppy. The puppy is lying down, facing forward, with its body mostly angled to the left. Its fur is predominantly black and white, with clear markings. It has a blue collar. The puppy should appear slightly out of focus compared to the path but still clear enough to see details.  The puppy is positioned in a patch of wildflowers, so it blends slightly with the foreground's natural elements.  The puppy should not obstruct the view of the path or the background, but it should be a clear focal point. The image should not look like a simple overlay, so make sure the lighting and shadows on the dog are consistent with the background's lighting.  The overall feel should be a serene and slightly whimsical image of a dog relaxing in a picturesque countryside setting. The path continues beyond the dog and leads up the hill towards the trees.
