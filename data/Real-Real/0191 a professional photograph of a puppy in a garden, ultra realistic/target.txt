Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene.  The background should consist of a well-maintained lawn, a single-story house with a brown roof, and several mature deciduous trees.  The house should be visible in the mid-ground, appearing slightly behind a chain-link fence that runs along the bottom third of the frame. The yard should be mostly green, with patches of light brown dirt visible, particularly near the bottom of the frame.

In the foreground, place a light brown Cockapoo dog. The dog should be positioned slightly off-center, closer to the lower right of the frame. It should be facing towards the viewer,  its body angled slightly to its left.  The dog's fur should be textured and appear slightly fluffy. Its mouth should be open slightly, giving the appearance of panting or excitement. The dog should be in sharp focus, contrasting with the slightly softer focus of the background. The dog's presence should not significantly alter the background, merely adding a cheerful element to the existing scene.  The overall lighting should be soft, suggesting daytime with partly cloudy skies.  The overall mood should be serene and peaceful.
