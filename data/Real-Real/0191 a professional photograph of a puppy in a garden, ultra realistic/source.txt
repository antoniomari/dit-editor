Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene on a slightly overcast day.  The style should be photorealistic, with a slightly muted color palette.

The scene features a large, mostly flat lawn of medium-green grass.  In the middle-ground, a single-story ranch-style house is visible. It's a light brownish-grey color, with a dark brown roof.  The house is partially obscured by mature, leafy green deciduous trees.  There's a hint of a wooden fence separating the backyard from the neighboring property. A small portion of a teal or greenish-blue structure (possibly a shed or playhouse) is visible near the house.

The foreground consists of a patch of bare, light beige or sandy earth, sparsely dotted with small, light-green plants.  A thin metal chain link fence runs along the left edge of the image from the foreground towards the house.  Some power lines are faintly visible running across the upper-middle section of the image.

The lighting should be soft and diffused, characteristic of an overcast day. There should be no harsh shadows.  The overall composition should feel calm, quiet, and slightly understated.  The focus should be on the spacious lawn and the house partially hidden behind the trees. The image should have a slightly wide angle perspective, giving a sense of the yard's size.
