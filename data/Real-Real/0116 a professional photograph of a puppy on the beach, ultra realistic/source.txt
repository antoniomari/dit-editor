Generate an image of a tranquil waterfront scene at sunset.  The style should be photorealistic, aiming for a slightly desaturated and muted color palette, akin to a high-quality photograph taken during the golden hour.


**Scene:**

The foreground should be dominated by a coarse, sandy beach, extending from the bottom of the frame towards the middle. The sand should be darkish brown with small pebbles and shells scattered throughout, showing some texture.  The focus should be slightly shallow, emphasizing the foreground sand.


The middle ground is a calm, still body of water, reflecting the sky and the bridge subtly.  The water should appear smooth, almost mirror-like, with a hint of motion blur suggesting a gentle current.


The background features a long, modern bridge spanning across the water. The bridge is a dark grey/black silhouette against the sky.   On the far side of the bridge, a few buildings are visibleâ€”the most prominent is a tall, rectangular building that resembles a high-rise hotel or office building.  The buildings should be relatively dark silhouettes, lacking detailed texture.


**Lighting:**

The lighting should be soft and diffused, characteristic of a sunset. The sky should be a mix of muted oranges, pinks, purples, and blues.  The clouds should be mostly cumulus, with some breaks in the cloud cover allowing for a subtle glow. The lighting on the bridge and buildings should be minimal, emphasizing their silhouettes against the brightly colored sky. The overall mood should be peaceful and serene.


**Composition:**

The composition should be a wide shot, placing the bridge centrally but slightly off-center to maintain visual interest.  The foreground sand provides a strong leading line into the scene. The water acts as a calm separator between the foreground and the background elements. The slightly muted, desaturated colors and soft lighting create a sense of calm and tranquility.


**Overall:** The image should evoke a feeling of quietude and natural beauty, focusing on the interplay of light, water, and architecture at sunset. The final image should have a high level of detail and realism.
