Generate an image of a sandy beach at sunset.  The beach is relatively flat and composed of small, dark-grey pebbles and lighter-colored sand. The water is calm, a dark grey-blue, reflecting the sky and cityscape.

In the background, create a cityscape featuring a long, multi-span bridge extending across the width of the image, slightly angled.  The bridge is dark grey, with distinct supports and roadways. Beyond the bridge, build a cityscape with several buildings, including a prominent high-rise building that is rectangular, light grey, and relatively tall. There should be a mix of other smaller buildings, some appearing taller than others, suggestive of a city skyline.  The sky is a soft blend of pastel oranges, purples, and blues, indicative of a sunset or sunrise, with clouds mostly concentrated towards the upper portion of the image.

In the foreground, place a West Highland White Terrier (Westie).  The Westie should be positioned slightly off-center, towards the left of the frame, sitting on the pebbly beach. The dog should be facing the viewer directly. The fur should be detailed and fluffy, appearing light cream to off-white, with noticeable texture. Its eyes should be alert and engaging. The Westie appears slightly smaller in scale than the cityscape background elements, to emphasize the scale of the background.  The dog should look relatively relaxed but attentive.  The lighting on the dog should complement the sunset, with some gentle highlights on its fur to make it look warm and inviting.

The overall scene should show a contrast between the calm, serene atmosphere of the beach and dog and the imposing, yet distant, presence of the city skyline and bridge. The image should have a peaceful, almost idyllic feel, despite the inclusion of the urban landscape. The Westie adds a sense of scale and a focal point to the otherwise wide, open landscape. There should be no significant change to the background other than the addition of the dog in the foreground.
