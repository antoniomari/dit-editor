Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene.  The background should depict a typical American suburban backyard: a neatly mown lawn, a modest single-story house with light-brown siding and a dark-brown roof visible in the mid-ground.  Several mature deciduous trees with full green canopies surround the house, providing ample shade.  A short chain-link fence runs along the left edge of the yard. The grass is a medium to light green, with some patches showing slightly lighter color or bare patches of earth, indicating potential dry areas.


In the foreground, centered slightly to the right, place a giant panda bear lying down on its side. The panda is positioned slightly off-center, angled to face slightly to the right. Its fur is realistically rendered, with the characteristic black and white markings. The panda appears relaxed and slightly rumpled, its posture suggesting it is resting peacefully.

The panda should be positioned on a patch of slightly less lush grass, which transitions naturally into a more barren patch of dry, light brown-tan dirt near the panda.  There is no noticeable disruption to the grass from the panda's presence â€“ it's as though it simply blends into the environment. The lighting should be consistent throughout the entire scene, suggesting a bright, sunny day.  The overall effect should be slightly surreal but photorealistic, giving the impression that the panda is a natural part of the suburban landscape.
