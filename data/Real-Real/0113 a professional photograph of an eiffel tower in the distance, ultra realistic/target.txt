Generate an image of a serene waterfront scene at sunset or sunrise. 


The background should depict a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water. The bridge is light gray concrete, with multiple spans and supports. Behind the bridge, a city skyline is visible, including tall buildings of varying heights and architectural styles. The sky is a dramatic blend of soft pastel colors near the horizon (pinks, oranges, yellows) gradually transitioning to deep blues and purples higher up, with wispy clouds spread across the sky. The water is relatively still, reflecting the sky and bridge somewhat. The overall lighting suggests either a sunset or sunrise.


The foreground element is a replica of the Eiffel Tower, noticeably smaller in scale than what it would be in reality, placed to the right of the bridge, slightly behind and to the right of the skyline.  The Eiffel Tower should be rendered in a slightly muted, light teal/blue-gray, perhaps suggesting nighttime lighting, slightly contrasting with the sunset colors but not clashing. The placement of the Eiffel Tower is somewhat unexpected and surreal, as if it has been digitally inserted into the scene. It should appear to be seamlessly blended, though slightly out of scale and slightly more saturated than the existing city buildings. The sand in the foreground of the image should be a dark greyish-brown, extending from the bottom edge to approximately one-third of the image's vertical height. The texture should be coarse and slightly uneven.  The water's edge is where the sand meets the water, indicating a calm, gently sloping beach.


The overall effect should be a juxtaposition of familiar and unexpected elements, creating a surreal yet beautiful landscape. The addition of the Eiffel Tower alters the feel of the scene, adding a whimsical and dreamlike quality to the otherwise realistic depiction of a city waterfront at sunset/sunrise.
