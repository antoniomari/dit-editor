Generate a pastoral landscape image in a slightly hazy, impressionistic style.  The scene should feature a gently sloping hillside with a meandering, well-worn dirt path cutting through the middle of the image from the background to the foreground.

**Foreground:** The foreground should be composed of a mix of tall, wild grasses, wildflowers (primarily yellow and orange hues, with hints of red), and some low-lying shrubs. The grass should be a light, slightly desaturated green, suggesting a summer afternoon.  The wildflowers should appear somewhat scattered, not tightly grouped. The path here is a light brown dirt road, showing signs of use.

**Midground:** The path continues into the midground, becoming slightly less defined.  The hillside flanking the path is filled with various shades of green, suggesting a field of tall grasses and wildflowers similar to the foreground, but more densely packed. The colors should be softer and less vibrant than the foreground.  The path is a natural color.

**Background:**  In the background, a hillside covered in a dense forest of dark green coniferous trees is visible.  The trees should appear slightly distant and hazy, suggesting depth and a sense of scale.  Some lighter, deciduous trees should be interspersed among the evergreens, providing contrast and texture.  The overall color palette should be muted greens and hints of reddish-brown in the foliage.  The lighting should suggest a sunny day, but the light should be diffuse, avoiding harsh shadows.

**Lighting:**  The lighting should be soft and diffused, creating a gentle, hazy atmosphere.  The sun should be high in the sky, casting soft shadows and avoiding harsh contrasts. The overall tone should be warm and inviting.

**Style:**  The overall style should evoke a feeling of serenity and tranquility.  The image should be slightly impressionistic in style, with a soft focus and slightly muted colors, avoiding overly sharp detail.  Think of a slightly blurry photograph taken on a hazy summer day.  The brushstrokes (if you are emulating brushstrokes) should be soft and blended. The overall resolution should be medium to high.

**Composition:**  The path should serve as a visual guide leading the eye from the foreground to the background. The composition should be balanced, with a natural feel and a sense of depth.  The slightly hazy effect should add to the overall peaceful atmosphere.
