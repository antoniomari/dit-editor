Generate an image of a living room scene.  The background should depict a light-colored, slightly beige living room with hardwood floors. The walls are a pale off-white, and there are several framed prints or artworks hanging on the walls, spaced evenly apart at a medium height. There's a doorway leading to another room (kitchen visible), which has white cabinets and a simple counter.  A white brick fireplace is on the right, with a black metal fire screen partially obscuring the firebox.  A small, dark wood bench sits against the wall next to the fireplace.  A built-in shelving unit is visible in the wall to the right of the doorway.  The overall lighting is soft and natural.

In the foreground, centered and slightly off to the left, place a dark brown, antique-style Japanese cabinet or chest.  This cabinet should be relatively tall and rectangular, with multiple drawers and small doors or compartments showing intricate wood grain and possibly lattice work details. It is placed near a floor lamp that is partially visible behind the cabinet, next to a TV, which is also behind the cabinet. It shouldn't overshadow the existing elements. The cabinet should be positioned so it is visible between the floor lamp and the TV but not blocking the doorway.  The style should be traditional Japanese, and the color should be a deep, rich brown. The wood should appear to be polished or varnished.

The overall effect should be a seamless blend, where the added cabinet appears as if it always belonged in the room, enhancing the space rather than disrupting it. The cabinet's dark color should contrast nicely with the light walls and floor, creating a focal point without being overpowering. The overall lighting should be consistent across the image, to fully integrate the foreground elements into the background setting.  The rug should be placed in front of the cabinet extending into the foreground.
