Generate an image of a cozy living room in a mid-century modern style.  The overall color palette should be warm and muted, with creamy beige walls and light-brown hardwood floors. The lighting should be soft and diffused, suggesting natural light supplemented by a floor lamp.

The scene should include:

* **Flooring:** Light brown, polished hardwood flooring with visible wood grain running parallel to the wall. A fluffy, off-white sheepskin rug is centrally placed in the foreground.

* **Walls:** Smooth, light beige or off-white walls with minimal texture.

* **Furniture:** A mid-century modern style wooden entertainment center, featuring a dark brown wood finish and a simple design with two doors and drawers. On top sits a flat-screen TV and a stereo system. Two dark brown bookshelf speakers flank the entertainment center. A simple dark brown wooden bench is positioned against the wall near the fireplace.

* **Decor:** Three small framed prints are hung on the wall above the entertainment center, exhibiting subtle minimalist art.  Other small framed prints are scattered on the wall near the fireplace, and there are glass jars on shelves built into the wall.


* **Fireplace:** A white brick fireplace is visible on the right, with a black metal fire screen partially obscuring the hearth. The bricks should be a slightly off-white, not starkly bright.


* **Kitchen View:** An open doorway reveals a small, well-organized kitchen.  The kitchen cabinets are white or off-white, and simple shelving is visible.  A few cooking utensils are subtly visible, adding realism.

* **Lighting:** The primary light source is soft, diffused natural light, possibly from a window outside the frame. A tall, slender floor lamp with a warm-toned shade is positioned next to the entertainment center, adding to the warm ambiance. A ceiling fan is visible in the upper-left corner.


* **Overall Composition:** The scene should have a relaxed and inviting feel, with a comfortable and uncluttered layout.  The composition should lead the eye from the rug in the foreground through the living room and into the kitchen area, creating a sense of depth. The style should be reminiscent of photography, striving for realism and natural lighting.  The perspective should be from a seated eye level position within the room.
