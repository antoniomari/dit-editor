Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene.  The background should feature a typical suburban house with a light brown or beige exterior.  The house is surrounded by lush green grass and mature deciduous trees, typical of a residential area.  A simple chain-link fence partially surrounds the yard.  There's a suggestion of a shed or other outbuilding to the left of the house, and the yard appears relatively well-maintained. The lighting suggests daytime with natural sunlight.


In the foreground, place a single adult Asian elephant.  The elephant should be positioned centrally, slightly off to the left, standing on a patch of light brown, somewhat sandy-looking ground.  The elephant's posture should be relaxed, perhaps slightly turned towards the camera, and facing somewhat towards the house. The elephant should be realistically rendered with visible details like wrinkles in its skin and the texture of its ears. Its size should be large in comparison to the house, creating a clear sense of scale and absurdity.  The elephant's presence should not appear to alter the background in any physical wayâ€”no trampled grass or signs of its presence other than its own placement.  The color palette should remain consistent with a natural, slightly muted look, ensuring the elephant integrates visually with the environment without looking overly jarring or digitally imposed.
