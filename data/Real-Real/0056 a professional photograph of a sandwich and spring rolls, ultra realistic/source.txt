Generate an image of a close-up shot of several golden-brown spring rolls arranged artfully on a clean white plate.  The spring rolls are slightly irregular in shape, suggesting a homemade or hand-rolled quality. Their surfaces should show subtle textural variations with some areas appearing crispier than others.

In the upper left corner of the plate, a small mound of shredded carrots and fresh green lettuce provides a contrasting splash of color.  A small, simple white ramekin filled with a dark brown, slightly glossy dipping sauce is positioned near the spring rolls, adding depth to the scene.

The lighting should be soft and diffused, casting gentle shadows that highlight the textures of the spring rolls and vegetables without harsh highlights.  The overall style should be naturalistic and appetizing, with a shallow depth of field to focus attention on the main subjectsâ€”the spring rolls and the sauce. The background is subtly blurred, indicating a simple, possibly wooden table. The overall color palette is warm and inviting, with the golden browns of the spring rolls contrasting beautifully against the cool white of the plate and the vibrant greens and oranges of the garnish. The overall composition is asymmetrical, yet balanced and visually pleasing.  The image should have a slightly warm color temperature.
