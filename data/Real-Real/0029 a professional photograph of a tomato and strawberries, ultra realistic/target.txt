Generate an image of a white plate containing several strawberries arranged in a loose circle.  In the center of the strawberries, place a large, ripe red tomato. The tomato should be positioned slightly above the plate, as if it's resting on top of the strawberries rather than directly on the plate. The tomato should appear almost perfectly round and slightly glossy, with subtle highlights reflecting light.  Its skin should be smooth with a few subtle imperfections, and the stem should be clearly visible at the top.

The strawberries surrounding the tomato should be a vibrant red, with a slightly matte texture, showcasing the individual seeds on the surface.  Some strawberries should be positioned slightly overlapping others, creating a natural, slightly irregular arrangement. The strawberries should be slightly smaller than the tomato, and their arrangement should not be perfectly symmetrical.  The plate should be a simple white, slightly glossy, and be large enough to accommodate all the fruit comfortably. The lighting should be soft and diffuse, preventing harsh shadows. The overall style should be realistic and photorealistic.
