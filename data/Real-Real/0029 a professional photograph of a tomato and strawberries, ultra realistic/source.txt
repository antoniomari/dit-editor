Generate a photorealistic image of a slice of tiramisu cake on a white plate surrounded by fresh strawberries.


**Scene:**  A single, generously sized slice of tiramisu cake is the focal point.  The cake is layered, showing distinct layers of coffee-soaked ladyfingers and a creamy, possibly mascarpone-based filling. The top is coated with a glossy, transparent glaze, possibly with a hint of reddish hue (like a strawberry glaze) and a visible dark brown coffee bean or chocolate decoration.

**Lighting:** Soft, diffused, and even lighting illuminates the scene, minimizing harsh shadows and highlighting the textures of both the cake and the strawberries. The lighting should be warm and inviting, emphasizing the deliciousness of the food.


**Style:** The style should be clean, elegant, and appetizing. Think of a high-quality food photography style, emphasizing detail and texture.  The overall mood should be calm and sophisticated.


**Composition:** The cake is positioned slightly off-center on a clean white rectangular plate. Fresh strawberries are artfully arranged around the cake, creating a visually appealing border. The strawberries should be varied in size and position, adding a natural and unforced feel. The plate itself should be simple and unadorned, allowing the food to take center stage.  There's a subtle hint of a background, possibly a muted off-white wall or surface, that is softly out of focus, drawing all attention to the food.


**Technical Details:** The image should be sharp and highly detailed, with a shallow depth of field to ensure the cake and strawberries are in focus, while the background is gently blurred. The textures of the cake (the airy cream, the slightly crumbly ladyfingers, the glossy glaze), and the strawberries (the glossy skin, the tiny seeds) should be accurately rendered. The colors should be vibrant and realistic, showing the richness of the cake and the bright red of the strawberries.
