Generate an image of a serene waterfront scene at sunset or sunrise.  The style should be photorealistic, with a slightly muted color palette emphasizing blues, grays, and muted oranges/pinks in the sky.

**Foreground:** The foreground is a gently sloping sandy beach, close to the viewer. The sand is a dark grayish-brown, with small pebbles and shell fragments scattered across the surface. The focus should be sharp in the immediate foreground, gradually softening as it recedes towards the water.

**Midground:** The midground is dominated by calm, dark water reflecting the sky and the bridge. The water's surface should have a slight motion blur effect, suggestive of a gentle current or tide.

**Background:** The background features a long, modern bridge stretching across a body of water. The bridge should be a dark gray or black, with subtle architectural details visible.  Behind the bridge, on the far side of the water, stands a tall, rectangular building, possibly a hotel or office building,  with a more muted dark gray or brown hue.   Additional, smaller buildings are visible to the right, less distinct than the primary building.

**Sky:** The sky is a dramatic feature, showcasing a cloudy sunset or sunrise.  The clouds should be a mix of dark blues, grays, and lighter pastel shades of orange and pink, particularly around the horizon. The clouds should be somewhat layered, with some areas denser and darker than others.  The light should be diffused, avoiding harsh shadows.


**Overall Composition:**  The composition should be balanced, with the bridge forming a strong horizontal line dividing the sky and water. The perspective should be from a low vantage point, emphasizing the expanse of the sky and water, placing the viewer at the beach level looking towards the bridge and the distant cityscape. The overall mood should be calm, peaceful, and slightly melancholic, evoking a sense of tranquility and vastness.
