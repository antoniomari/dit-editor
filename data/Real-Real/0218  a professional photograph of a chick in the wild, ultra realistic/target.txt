Generate an image of a gently sloping hillside with a dirt path meandering through it.  The hillside is covered in lush, vibrant green grass, interspersed with patches of wildflowers in yellow and other muted colors.  The background should show a dense forest of evergreen trees on the upper portion of the hill, transitioning to smaller, deciduous trees and shrubs further down.  The overall lighting should be bright and sunny, casting soft shadows.


In the mid-ground, along the dirt path, a small, fluffy, golden-yellow duckling is positioned slightly off-center. The duckling should be facing to the right of the frame, appearing calm and serene. It should be in focus, contrasting subtly with the slightly softer focus of the background. The duckling should blend naturally with the grass and wildflowers, as if it is part of the scene, not awkwardly superimposed.

The dirt path should be a light brownish-grey color, showing some texture, and be relatively well-maintained but not perfectly smooth. The path should continue beyond the duckling, leading the eye towards the background forest. There shouldn't be any abrupt changes in the background where the duckling is placed. The overall scene should appear natural and idyllic, as if a snapshot of a peaceful countryside. The duckling's presence should add a sense of whimsical charm to the otherwise natural landscape.
