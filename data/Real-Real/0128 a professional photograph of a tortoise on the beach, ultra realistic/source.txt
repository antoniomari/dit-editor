Generate an image of a serene waterfront scene at sunset or sunrise.  The focus should be a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water. The bridge should be a dark gray or black silhouette against a vibrant, but not overly saturated, sky.


**Sky:** The sky should be a dramatic blend of colors.  The upper portion should be a deep blue, transitioning to softer pastel hues of pink, orange, and yellow near the horizon.  Include fluffy, somewhat dramatic clouds, with a slightly hazy or diffused quality, suggesting a soft light.


**Bridge:** The bridge should be a significant element in the composition, spanning most of the image's width.  It should be realistically detailed, showing its structural elements, but without excessive texture.  The bridge's silhouette should be clearly defined against the sky.


**Water:** The water should be relatively calm, reflecting the sky's colors subtly.  A slight motion blur effect on the water would add to the sense of tranquility and movement.  The water should be dark, a slightly desaturated blue or gray, reflecting the light from the sky.


**Foreground:** The foreground should consist of a sandy beach, in focus but with a shallow depth of field.  The sand should be a dark brownish-gray, with small pebbles and possibly some scattered debris visible in a close-up perspective.


**Background:** In the background, to the right of the bridge, a relatively tall, rectangular building, possibly a hotel or office tower, should be visible.  It should be dark, a solid silhouette, with little to no detail.  A hint of other buildings, barely visible, could be added to the far background to imply a city skyline.


**Lighting:** The lighting should suggest either a sunrise or sunset.  The sun itself should be unseen, but its effects on the clouds and the subtle reflection on the water should be apparent. The overall lighting should be soft and even, without harsh shadows.


**Style:**  The overall style should be photorealistic, leaning slightly towards a slightly moody or melancholic atmosphere. Aim for a cinematic quality, like a still from a movie.  The image should have a slightly desaturated, subdued palette, avoiding overly vibrant or artificial colors.


**Composition:** Use a low-angle shot from a beach perspective, emphasizing the bridge as the central element, while having the sky and water balance the composition. The foreground should draw the viewer's eye towards the bridge and the cityscape beyond.
