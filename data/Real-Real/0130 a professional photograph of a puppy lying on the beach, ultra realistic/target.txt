Generate an image of a tranquil waterfront scene at sunset.  The background should feature a long, multi-span bridge stretching across a calm body of water.  Behind the bridge, a cityscape is visible, dominated by a tall, rectangular building. The sky should be a blend of soft pastel pinks and oranges at the horizon, gradually transitioning to deeper blues and purples overhead, with scattered clouds adding depth. The water should be relatively still, reflecting the sky and the city lights subtly.

The foreground element is a small, fluffy white dog, specifically a Bichon Frise or similar breed puppy.  The puppy is lying down on a sandy beach, close to the water's edge. It's positioned slightly off-center, about one-third of the way up from the bottom of the frame.  The puppy should appear relaxed and peaceful, its fur looking soft and slightly highlighted by the soft light of the setting sun.  The sand should be a dark, gravelly texture, contrasting with the bright white fur of the puppy. There's a slight sense that the puppy has been digitally added and integrated into the scene without altering the background elements, like footprints or other obvious edits to make the sand look disturbed. The overall effect should be a serene, slightly whimsical image with a touch of calm contrast between the urban background and the peaceful puppy.  Ensure the lighting on the puppy is consistent with the sunset lighting, so it doesn't appear overly bright or out of place.
