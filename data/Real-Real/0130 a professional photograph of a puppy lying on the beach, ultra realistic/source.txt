Generate a photorealistic image of a tranquil waterfront scene at sunset.Â 


**Scene:** The main focus is a long, modern bridge stretching across a calm body of water.  The bridge is dark grey or black in silhouette against the sunset sky.  On the far side of the bridge, a cityscape is visible, featuring several buildings, the most prominent being a tall, rectangular high-rise building. Other buildings are shorter and less distinct. The foreground is a gently sloping sandy beach or shore, with small pebbles and grains of sand visible in close detail.  There are a few boats or small vessels visible near the bridge's base.


**Lighting:** The lighting should mimic a sunset. The sky should be a blend of soft pastel colors:  pale oranges, yellows, and pinks near the horizon, gradually transitioning to deeper blues and purples higher up.  The clouds should be dramatic yet relatively calm, with some areas thicker and darker than others. The bridge and buildings should be in silhouette, largely dark, illuminated only by the remaining light from the setting sun reflecting on their surfaces. The water should reflect the colors of the sky and the sky's reflection should be slightly blurred, suggesting gentle movement. The foreground beach should be subtly lit, suggesting a soft, diffused light source.


**Style:**  The overall style should be evocative of a peaceful, slightly melancholic mood.  The image should have a slightly desaturated look, avoiding overly vibrant or saturated colors. The image should have a cinematic quality, with a strong sense of depth and perspective. The focus should be sharp on the foreground beach, gradually softening towards the background, creating a sense of distance. The overall resolution should be high, capable of showing fine details.


**Composition:** The bridge and the cityscape should be positioned in the middle ground, taking up a significant portion of the frame but not dominating it. The foreground sandy beach should occupy about one-third to one-half of the frame, leading the viewer's eye towards the bridge and skyline. The sky should take up the remaining upper portion of the frame.  The perspective should be from a low vantage point, looking towards the bridge and skyline, creating a sense of vastness.


**Additional notes:** The water should be relatively calm, almost glassy, with very subtle ripples indicating gentle movement.  The sand should be fine-grained and uniformly textured, with some small pebbles and debris scattered across it, giving it a natural look. The image should have a slightly long exposure feel, with subtle motion blur evident in the water. The overall color palette should be muted and warm, emphasizing the peaceful sunset atmosphere.
