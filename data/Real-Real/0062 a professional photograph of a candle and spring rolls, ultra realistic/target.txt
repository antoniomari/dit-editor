Generate an image of a plate of golden-brown spring rolls arranged artfully on a white plate.  The spring rolls are various sizes and slightly overlapping, suggesting a casual, appetizing arrangement.  They should appear freshly fried and crispy.  Beside the spring rolls is a small, white ramekin containing a dark reddish-brown dipping sauce.  A small pile of shredded carrots and lettuce is situated to the left of the ramekin.  

In the foreground, slightly overlapping the spring rolls and the dipping sauce, is a lit tea light candle. The candle is dark grey or black, with a translucent amber colored wax and a clearly visible bright yellow flame. The candle is placed to slightly obscure some of the spring rolls and slightly off-center, creating a visually interesting juxtaposition between the savory food and the warm, inviting light of the candle. The overall lighting of the image should be soft and warm, highlighting the golden tones of the spring rolls and the glow of the candlelight. The white plate provides a clean, crisp contrast to the warm colors. The background is intentionally blurred, suggesting a simple, uncluttered table setting.
