Generate an image of a plush, light brown teddy bear sitting on a rocky outcrop overlooking a vast, sun-drenched landscape.

**Scene:** The teddy bear is the focal point, positioned slightly off-center.  It sits amidst grey and brown rocks, some large, some small, suggesting a weathered, ancient site.  The rocks have varied texturesâ€”some smooth, others rough and jagged.  In the background, a wide vista unfolds, showcasing rolling hills and a distant, pale green valley.  The hills are subtly textured, showing variations in terrain.  The sky is a clear, bright blue, almost cloudless.

**Lighting:** The scene is bathed in bright, natural sunlight.  The light is even and diffuse, with minimal shadows, creating a warm, sunny ambiance. The light illuminates the teddy bear clearly, bringing out the texture of its fur. The rocks are well-lit, showing detail and texture.

**Style:** The overall style should be photorealistic, with a slightly documentary feel. The colors are natural and muted, emphasizing the earthy tones of the landscape and the warm brown of the teddy bear. The focus should be sharp on the teddy bear and the immediate foreground, with the background slightly softer in focus.  The image should convey a sense of serenity and vastness.

**Composition:** The composition should guide the viewer's eye from the teddy bear towards the expansive background. The rocks in the foreground act as a natural frame for the bear and lead the eye deeper into the scene.  The rule of thirds is subtly used, with the bear off-center to create a more balanced composition. The vastness of the landscape contrasts with the small size of the teddy bear, creating a sense of scale and perspective.  There is a sense of tranquility and loneliness evoked by the solitary bear in the vast landscape.
