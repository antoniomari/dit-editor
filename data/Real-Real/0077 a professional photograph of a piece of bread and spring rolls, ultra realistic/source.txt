Generate an image of a close-up shot of a plate of freshly fried spring rolls, arranged artfully on a bright white plate.  The spring rolls should be golden-brown and slightly glistening, showcasing a crisp texture.  Some should be slightly overlapping, suggesting a casual, appetizing arrangement.  

Next to the spring rolls, include a small, white ramekin filled with a dark reddish-brown dipping sauce. The sauce should appear slightly glossy and viscous.  A small garnish of shredded carrots and bright green lettuce leaves should be positioned near the sauce and spring rolls, providing a vibrant color contrast.

The lighting should be soft and diffused, mimicking natural light, avoiding harsh shadows.  The overall style should be clean, bright, and photorealistic, focusing on the details of the food's texture and color. The composition should emphasize the spring rolls as the central focus, with the sauce and garnish playing supporting roles. The background should be subtly blurred, with a hint of a light-brown wooden surface barely visible under the plate, allowing the food to stand out. The overall aesthetic should convey freshness and deliciousness.  The image should have a shallow depth of field, focusing sharply on the spring rolls and sauce while softly blurring the background and the edges of the garnish.
