Generate a pastoral landscape image in a slightly hazy, impressionistic style.  The scene should depict a gently sloping hillside leading to a distant line of dark green coniferous trees forming a backdrop.

The foreground should consist of a grassy path, slightly uneven and winding its way from the bottom center towards the mid-ground.  This path is bordered by tall, wild grasses and wildflowers, including splashes of yellow wildflowers, primarily concentrated in the bottom left and lower middle areas.  The grass color should be a light, slightly desaturated green, suggesting a summer day.

The mid-ground features a slightly higher area of grasses, gradually transitioning into a small grove of reddish-brown deciduous trees. These trees should be relatively small and loosely clustered, offering a slight break in the vast expanse of green.

The background is dominated by a dense forest of evergreen trees, appearing somewhat distant and blurred to emphasize depth of field. The lighting should be soft and diffused, suggesting a mostly sunny day with minimal harsh shadows. The overall color palette should be muted and naturalistic, with predominantly greens and yellows, accented by the subtle reddish-brown of the deciduous trees.  The style should evoke a peaceful, slightly dreamy rural scene, with a gentle, atmospheric perspective.  A barely visible suggestion of a wire fence can be seen in the middle ground.  The overall image should have a slightly muted, almost painterly quality with a hint of softness and haziness.  The resolution should be high enough to show detail in the foreground wildflowers but still maintaining the impressionistic quality.
