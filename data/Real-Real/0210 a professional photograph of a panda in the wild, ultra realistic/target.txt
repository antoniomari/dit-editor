Generate an image of a rolling green hill landscape, similar to a nature preserve.  The hillside is dotted with various shades of green vegetation, including bushes and taller trees, primarily evergreen. A faint, light dirt path meanders across the middle ground, slightly uphill from the bottom edge.  Wildflowers, predominantly yellow, are sparsely scattered throughout the grassy areas, especially near the bottom.  The sky is not visible, with the hill taking up the entire frame.

In the foreground, slightly below the center of the image and slightly to the left, place a giant panda bear. The panda is lying down, almost as if it's resting or taking a nap, with its body angled slightly to the right.  Its fur is realistically textured, a light tan/brown on its face and shoulders, gradually darkening to black on its ears, legs, and signature eye patches.  The black fur should appear sleek and smooth.   Ensure the panda is in sharp focus, contrasting with a slightly softer focus on the background hill. The panda should interact with the landscape by being positioned in the grass, partially obscuring some of the yellow wildflowers.  The panda shouldn't appear digitally imposed, aiming for seamless integration with the background's lighting and overall scene.  The lighting should suggest a sunny day. The overall effect should evoke a peaceful, serene scene of a panda resting in its natural habitat.
