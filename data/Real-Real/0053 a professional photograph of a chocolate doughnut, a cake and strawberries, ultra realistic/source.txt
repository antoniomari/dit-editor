Generate a photorealistic image of a slice of tiramisu cake on a white plate surrounded by fresh strawberries.


**Scene:** The scene is a close-up shot of a single, elegantly presented slice of tiramisu on a clean, white, rectangular plate.  Surrounding the cake are several whole, ripe strawberries, arranged artfully but somewhat casually, not perfectly symmetrical.


**Lighting:** The lighting is soft and diffused, likely from a softbox or indirect natural light source. There should be minimal harsh shadows, creating a gentle and inviting mood. The lighting should highlight the creamy texture of the tiramisu and the glossy sheen of the strawberries, emphasizing their juiciness and color.


**Cake Details:** The tiramisu slice is a classic style, showcasing distinct layers. The bottom layer should be a rich, dark brown coffee-soaked ladyfinger biscuit.  The middle layer should be a thick layer of creamy mascarpone cheese, appearing light and airy.  The top layer is also a light creamy layer possibly with a hint of coffee, topped with a clear, glossy gelatin or glaze that reflects the light.  A single coffee bean is visible embedded in the glaze.


**Strawberries:**  The strawberries are bright red, plump and seemingly fresh.  Their surfaces should have a subtle sheen indicating their moisture content. There should be variations in the size and positioning of the strawberries to give a natural look.


**Style:** The overall style should be clean, simple, and visually appealing, suggesting a high-quality dessert presentation.  The photo should have a slightly shallow depth of field, softly blurring the background to keep the focus on the cake and strawberries.  The background should be a simple out-of-focus light beige/off-white, avoiding any distracting elements.  The overall tone should be warm and inviting, without being overly saturated.


**Composition:** The tiramisu slice is positioned slightly off-center, creating a more dynamic composition. The strawberries are artfully arranged around the cake, leading the viewer's eye toward the main subject.  The plate is the dominant feature, providing a clean contrast to the rich colors of the cake and strawberries.  The aspect ratio should be similar to a typical food photography shot.
