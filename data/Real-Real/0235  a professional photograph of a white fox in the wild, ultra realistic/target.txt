Generate an image of a gently sloping grassy hillside, receding into a background of lush green forest. The foreground is a field of tall grass with scattered yellow wildflowers.  A well-defined grassy path meanders from the lower center of the image towards the middle ground, where it disappears into the vegetation near a small cluster of bushes. The hillside itself is dappled with sunshine, suggesting a bright, possibly summery day.  The trees in the background are varied in height and density, creating a natural and realistic forest edge.

The foreground element is a single Arctic fox, positioned slightly off-center, toward the lower right quadrant of the image. The fox is facing left, its gaze directed along the path. It is a bright, pure white, appearing soft and fluffy, and is sitting in a natural, alert posture.  The fox is seamlessly integrated into the scene, as if it naturally belongs in the field, and doesn't appear to be superimposed harshly.  The overall lighting on the fox matches the lighting in the scene, making it look natural and not artificially illuminated. The placement of the fox enhances the natural feeling, appearing as though the fox is observing the scene, making the viewer feel as though they are a part of the scene. The addition of the fox creates a calm, peaceful atmosphere, inviting a sense of tranquility. The base background, the hillside and forest, remains unchanged except for the addition of the fox in the foreground. There should be no visible artifacts of compositing.  The entire image should have a high resolution and realistic rendering of textures and lighting.
