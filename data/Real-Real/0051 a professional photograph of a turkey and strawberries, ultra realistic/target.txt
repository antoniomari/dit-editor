Generate an image of a roasted chicken breast positioned on top of a slice of cheesecake. The chicken should be positioned slightly off-center, leaning towards the left side of the image.  The cheesecake should be partially visible underneath, providing a light beige/yellowish contrast to the brown of the chicken.Â 


The entire scene is placed on a white rectangular plate, surrounded by fresh strawberries. The strawberries should be arranged somewhat haphazardly around the chicken and cheesecake, with some partially overlapping each other.  The strawberries should be bright red and glossy, with clearly defined seeds. They should be realistically rendered, conveying a sense of freshness and juiciness. The plate itself should be clean and white, with slight shadowing underneath to suggest depth and dimension.

The lighting of the entire scene should be soft and diffused, avoiding harsh shadows and highlighting the textures of the chicken skin, the cheesecake's surface, and the strawberries' glossy surfaces.  The overall feeling should be one of appetizing deliciousness, but also a slightly surreal juxtaposition of unexpected food pairings. The background should be a simple, out-of-focus blur; a light beige color is acceptable.
