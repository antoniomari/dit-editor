Generate an image of a close-up shot of a slice of tiramisu cake on a white plate, surrounded by fresh strawberries.


**Scene:** The main focus is a triangular slice of tiramisu cake.  The cake has distinct layers: a bottom layer of coffee-soaked ladyfingers, a middle layer of creamy mascarpone filling, and a top layer of a glossy, possibly gelatinous, topping. A single dark brown coffee bean or chocolate decoration is visible on the top layer. The cake looks rich and decadent.  Surrounding the cake are several fresh, ripe strawberries, arranged somewhat casually, but neatly around the cake on a clean white plate.


**Lighting:** The lighting is soft and even, avoiding harsh shadows. It appears to be natural or soft artificial light, casting a gentle glow on the cake and strawberries, highlighting their textures and colors. The background is softly illuminated, out of focus, providing a contrast to the sharpness of the main subject.


**Style:** The style should be realistic, aiming for high-quality photorealism. The image should be crisp and clear, showing fine details like the texture of the cake layers, the seeds in the strawberries, and the glossiness of the cake's topping. The overall feeling should be one of deliciousness and elegance.


**Composition:**  The cake is the central element, positioned slightly off-center to create visual interest.  The strawberries are strategically placed to complement the cake, creating a pleasing visual balance. The white plate provides a clean and uncluttered background, drawing the eye directly to the dessert.  The background should be very blurred and unassuming - perhaps a hint of a neutral colored wall.  A small portion of a neutral colored surface (such as wood or light-colored countertop) might be visible at the very bottom edge of the frame. The overall composition is designed to create an appetizing and visually appealing image.
