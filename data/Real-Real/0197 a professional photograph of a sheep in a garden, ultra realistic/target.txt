Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene. The background should depict a typical suburban backyard with a single-story house, mature trees, a chain-link fence, and a relatively well-maintained lawn. The house should be a light brown color with visible windows and a simple design. The trees should be leafy and green, suggesting it's springtime or summertime.  The grass should be predominantly green, with some patches showing slightly drier, lighter coloration, typical of a real lawn.

In the foreground, place a single, adult sheep. The sheep should be positioned centrally in the image, roughly in the lower middle third of the frame. The sheep should be a light brownish-grey color, with thick, somewhat shaggy wool. Its pose should be natural and relaxed, as if it's simply standing in the yard.  The sheep's wool should have subtle variations in shading, suggesting depth and texture.

The sheep should appear to be standing on the relatively bare, light brown-colored earth of the yard, rather than directly in the lusher green grass.  There should be a subtle contrast between the sheep's wool texture and the slightly rougher texture of the ground it's standing on.

The overall lighting should be natural daylight, suggesting an overcast or slightly hazy day, with no harsh shadows.  The image should have a slightly whimsical or surreal feel, due to the unexpected presence of the sheep in a suburban setting. The juxtaposition of the ordinary suburban scene with the unusual presence of the sheep should be clear and easily discernible.
