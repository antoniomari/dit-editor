Generate a photorealistic image of a suburban backyard scene on an overcast day.  The composition should be from a slightly low angle, looking towards a house across a grassy lawn.

**Scene:**

* The foreground consists of a patch of pale, sandy soil sparsely dotted with small, light green weeds, transitioning into a lush, vibrant green lawn occupying the midground. The lawn is even and relatively short, showing a slightly uneven texture.
* In the background is a single-story house with a brown shingle roof.  The house appears to be a light beige or off-white color.  It has several windows visible, but details like window trim are not crucial. A portion of a taller building, possibly another house or structure, can be seen slightly to the right and slightly further back than the main house.
* Between the observer and the house is a chain-link fence that runs along the left and background edges of the image. Part of a taller wooden fence is also visible near the house to the left. There's also a partially visible taller object behind the fence, perhaps a shed or privacy screen, appearing light teal or green in color.
* Mature deciduous trees with full, green leaves are abundant, framing the house and creating a somewhat shaded atmosphere. The trees are various types, with varied leaf density and branching patterns.

**Lighting:**

* The lighting should be soft and diffuse, indicative of an overcast sky. There should be no harsh shadows. The overall color palette is muted and natural, with greens and browns dominating.

**Style:**

* The style should be photorealistic and naturalistic.  The image should look like a photograph of a typical backyard scene. Avoid any overtly stylized or artistic effects.

**Overall Composition:**

* The perspective should be roughly from the ground level, giving the viewer a sense of being in the yard. The house should be the focal point, but the expansive lawn and surrounding trees should also be prominent features.  The depth of field should be relatively shallow, with a slight blur at the distant background house. The fence provides a clear visual separator.  The overall mood should be peaceful and serene.
