Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene on a slightly overcast day.  The style should be photorealistic, with a focus on natural light and accurate color representation.

**Scene:** The main focus is a large, mostly flat lawn of vibrant green grass extending from the foreground to a mid-ground.  The lawn is somewhat uneven in texture, with slightly sandy patches visible nearer to the foreground. A simple chain-link fence runs along the left and partially visible in the back, bordering the lawn.  Beyond the fence and lawn, sits a single-story house with a brown shingle roof and light-colored siding.  The house is partially obscured by mature, leafy green trees. There are additional houses and trees visible in the background, suggesting a residential neighborhood. Small bushes and some slightly unkempt landscaping are visible around the main house. A hint of something possibly resembling a grill or outdoor furniture is visible near the back fence.


**Lighting:** The lighting should be soft and diffused, characteristic of a cloudy day.  There are no harsh shadows, and the light should be evenly distributed across the scene. The overall color palette is muted, with greens dominating the scene.

**Composition:**  The perspective is from a slightly low vantage point, looking across the lawn towards the house. The house and surrounding trees are positioned slightly off-center, creating a balanced yet slightly asymmetrical composition.  The foreground sandy patch leads the eye to the main lawn and then to the house in the mid-ground. The trees provide a natural frame around the house and provide depth to the image.

**Overall:** The image should convey a peaceful, somewhat tranquil atmosphere, typical of a quiet suburban backyard on a cloudy afternoon. The focus should be on natural elements, with the house serving as a secondary element within the composition. The image should avoid any overly saturated colors or artificial enhancements.  The overall tone should be slightly cool, matching the lighting conditions.
