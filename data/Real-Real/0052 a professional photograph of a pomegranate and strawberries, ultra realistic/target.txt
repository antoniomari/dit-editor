Generate an image of a white plate containing several strawberries arranged around a large, halved pomegranate.

**Foreground:** The main foreground element is a large, juicy-looking half of a pomegranate.  Its arils are a vibrant, deep red, and the membrane is a pale, creamy off-white. The pomegranate is positioned slightly off-center, closer to the top and left of the plate.  The cut surface of the pomegranate faces the viewer, showcasing the numerous seeds.

**Background:** The background is a white plate.  It's subtly reflective, showing a slight sheen.  Around the pomegranate are several fresh strawberries.  These strawberries are arranged somewhat haphazardly, but generally clustered around the pomegranate, creating a natural and appealing composition. The strawberries are a bright, consistent red, with visible seeds.  Some are whole, and some are slightly angled. They are realistically textured, showing slight imperfections and variations in color.

**Interaction:** The pomegranate dominates the foreground, and the strawberries are clearly secondary, acting as a complementary element. The pomegranate appears to rest gently on the strawberries, creating a visual sense of depth and layering. The overall composition suggests a still life of fresh fruit. There is no significant alteration to the background apart from the addition of the pomegranate and strawberries. The background implied by the initial photo seems to be simply a white plate.  The focus should be sharp on both the pomegranate and the strawberries. The lighting should be soft and diffused, highlighting the natural colors and textures of the fruits.
