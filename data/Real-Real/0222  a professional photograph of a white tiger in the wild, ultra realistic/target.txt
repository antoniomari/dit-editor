Generate an image of a serene, grassy hillside landscape.  The hillside gently slopes down from the top of the frame to a dirt path in the lower third. The background consists of a lush green field speckled with yellow wildflowers, framed by a line of deciduous trees on the mid-ground and a denser forest of evergreens in the distance on the upper third. The overall lighting should be soft and diffused, suggesting a sunny but slightly hazy day.

The foreground element is a single white tiger, lying down and slightly to the left of the center of the frame. The tiger is positioned along the dirt path, its body largely in the lower third of the image. It's resting peacefully, its head slightly bowed, seemingly observing the wildflowers near it. The tiger's fur should be detailed, showing its distinct white coat with faint dark stripes.  The tiger's presence adds a sense of tranquility and unexpected wildness to the otherwise pastoral scene. The tiger should be rendered with photorealistic detail and be integrated seamlessly into the background, casting a believable shadow. The overall impression should be one of peaceful coexistence between the majestic animal and the idyllic landscape. The background should remain largely untouched; the tiger simply sits within it, undisturbed.
