Generate an image depicting a long, straight two-lane asphalt road stretching from the foreground to the middle ground under a mostly sunny sky. On either side of the road are grassy verges; the verge on the left, closer to the viewer, is bordered by a field of tall, dry corn stalks. In the background, a large, light-beige, multi-story building resembling a grand hotel or office building, occupies a significant portion of the horizon line.


In the foreground, partially obscuring the lower left corner of the image, is a fluffy, light beige teddy bear. The bear is positioned to the left of the road, with its face angled slightly toward the viewer. The bear appears friendly and soft, with visible stitching details around its features. The bear's placement creates a sense of scale, emphasizing the vastness of the landscape and the distance to the large building.  The overall lighting is bright and natural, suggesting daytime conditions.  The color scheme is mainly earth tones - greens, browns, and beige. The texture contrast between the soft fur of the bear and the hard asphalt should be clear. The image should have a surreal, slightly whimsical quality due to the juxtaposition of the everyday object (the bear) with the grand, distant building.
