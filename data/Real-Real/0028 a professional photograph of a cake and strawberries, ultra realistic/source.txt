Generate a photorealistic image of a slice of tiramisu cake on a white rectangular plate, surrounded by fresh strawberries.


**Scene:** The main focus is a single, generous slice of tiramisu.  The cake should appear creamy and decadent, with clearly defined layers visible: a bottom layer of coffee-soaked ladyfingers, a middle layer of creamy mascarpone, and a top layer of additional mascarpone, possibly with a light glaze or jelly on top. A small, dark coffee bean or chocolate decoration is visible on the glazed top.


**Lighting:** The lighting should be soft and diffused, avoiding harsh shadows. The light should enhance the textures of the cake (the airy mascarpone, the slightly browned ladyfingers) and the glossy shine of the glaze (if present) and the strawberries.  A subtle highlight should catch the top of the cake.


**Style:** The overall style is clean, elegant, and appetizing.  The background should be minimalist, perhaps a softly blurred, light-neutral backdrop to keep the attention on the cake and strawberries. Avoid busy backgrounds.  The image should evoke a feeling of sophistication and deliciousness.


**Composition:** The tiramisu slice is slightly off-center, with the strawberries arranged around it in a somewhat loose, natural-looking way, not too perfectly symmetrical.  A few strawberries should be slightly overlapping for a more dynamic visual. The plate is white and simple, the focus entirely on the cake and the fruit.  The aspect ratio should be approximately 3:2 or similar.  The viewpoint should be slightly elevated to give a good overview.


**Details:** The strawberries should be ripe and red, with visible seeds and a slight sheen. Their surface texture should be detailed, but not excessively. The plate should reflect a slight amount of light. The overall colour palette is primarily whites, creams, browns from the cake, and vibrant reds from the strawberries.
