Generate an image of a pale teal round cake, frosted with a design resembling stylized swirling leaves or vines centered on the top.  The design is embossed and slightly raised from the cake surface. The cake sits on a white plate surrounded by fresh strawberries.

Specifically:

* **Cake:** The cake is a light teal, almost a pastel shade.  The frosting is smooth and appears slightly glossy. The central design is clean and symmetrical, with a pale, possibly white, frosting used to create the raised pattern. The cake's base is slightly visible around the perimeter.

* **Strawberries:**  Several ripe, red strawberries are arranged around the base of the cake. They appear fresh and juicy. Some strawberries are partially overlapped, creating a natural-looking arrangement. The strawberries are slightly more in the foreground than the cake.  A few strawberries are behind and partially obscured by the cake.

* **Plate:** The cake and strawberries rest on a simple, clean white plate. The plate is slightly wider than the cake. It should be reflective, showing a slight sheen.

* **Interaction:** The cake sits squarely on the plate. The strawberries are placed artistically but slightly haphazardly at the cake's base, as if used to both decorate and prop it up. The strawberries don't overlap the cake's design. The overall arrangement is simple but appealing.  The image should have good lighting, highlighting both the cake's frosting and the strawberries' shine.  The background should be mostly out-of-focus, perhaps suggesting a light-colored table or surface. No other objects should be sharply in focus besides the cake, strawberries, and plate.
