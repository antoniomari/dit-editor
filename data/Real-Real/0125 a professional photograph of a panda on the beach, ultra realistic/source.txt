Generate an image of a tranquil waterfront scene at sunset. 


**Scene:** The main focus is a long, low-slung bridge spanning a calm body of water.  The bridge is a dark gray or black silhouette against a vibrant sky.  Behind the bridge, a cityscape is visible, featuring a prominent, dark, rectangular high-rise building as the most distinct structure. Other buildings are visible but less detailed.  A sandy foreground beach extends from the bottom of the frame toward the water. The water itself is relatively calm with subtle reflections of the sky and bridge.


**Lighting:** The lighting is a key element. It's a sunset scene with a mix of warm and cool tones. The sky should have a blend of pastel pinks and oranges near the horizon, gradually transitioning to cooler blues and purples higher up.  The clouds should be dramatic but not overly stormy, with a sense of movement and texture. The bridge and city are silhouetted against the bright sky, creating a strong contrast.  The light should reflect gently on the water.


**Style:** The overall style should be photorealistic but with a slightly dreamy or atmospheric quality. The colors should be rich and saturated but not overly processed.  The image should have a somewhat cinematic feel, perhaps mimicking the look of a slightly desaturated film photograph.


**Composition:** Use a low angle perspective, placing the beach in the foreground, leading the viewer's eye towards the bridge and cityscape. The bridge should be positioned roughly in the middle third of the frame, creating a sense of balance. The city should be placed further back, giving a sense of distance and scale. The sky should occupy a significant portion of the upper part of the image, emphasizing the dramatic light. The focus should be sharpest on the bridge and the closest part of the beach, with a subtle decrease in sharpness as the distance increases. Use a wide-angle lens perspective to capture the whole scene.
