Generate an image of a tranquil waterfront scene at sunset.  The background should depict a cityscape featuring a long, multi-span bridge stretching across a calm body of water.  The bridge is dark gray or black, and the water reflects the sky and city lights subtly.  Behind the bridge, a cityscape is visible, featuring several buildings, including a prominent, tall, rectangular building that stands out. The sky should be a mixture of pastel sunset colors (pinks, oranges, and purples) blending into a cooler blue at the top.  Clouds are present, giving a dramatic but peaceful feel.

In the foreground, place a young giant panda. It is positioned on a dark gray, sandy beach near the water's edge. The panda is slightly angled to the left, and appears to be small, possibly a cub,  and is actively interacting with some small, sparse blades of grass or vegetation close to it.  The panda's fur should be highly detailed, showing its characteristic black and white markings. Its expression should be calm and peaceful.

The overall effect should show the panda as a contrasting element of unexpected cuteness against the urban background. The scene should feel peaceful and slightly surreal, highlighting the unusual juxtaposition of a wild animal in an urban setting, but in a way that doesn't feel jarring or overly manipulated. The lighting should be consistent, with the sunset hues casting a warm glow on the scene, while the panda is clearly lit and in focus. The overall image quality should be high resolution and photographic realism.
