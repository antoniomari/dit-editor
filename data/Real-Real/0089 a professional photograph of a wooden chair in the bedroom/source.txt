Generate a photorealistic image of a living room scene.  The room features a warm, polished, light brown hardwood floor with visible wood grain.  The floorboards run horizontally across the image.  

The walls are two-toned: a vibrant teal blue covers a majority of one wall, while the remaining walls are a soft, creamy off-white.   The teal wall is mostly smooth and unblemished.

The main furniture is a beige fabric loveseat positioned against the teal wall. The loveseat has three beige throw pillows arranged on it. A matching beige fabric armchair is partially visible in the bottom left corner.

A dark brown, oval-shaped coffee table with ornate legs stands in the center of the room between the loveseat and the armchair. On the coffee table sits a dark blue glass vase holding a small, light green floral arrangement (perhaps a small chrysanthemum bush).

Natural light streams in from a window with a light-yellow curtain (partially visible) set in a dark wood frame on the off-white wall.   The window is rectangular and traditional in style. A second, similar window is visible in the far right corner but is obscured by the edge of the image.  The lighting is soft and diffuse, suggesting a daytime setting.

The overall style is simple and understated, with a touch of casual elegance. The color palette is cohesive, utilizing warm and cool tones in harmony. The composition should be centered around the loveseat and coffee table, with the floor providing a grounding element.  The image should have a slight sense of spaciousness, with minimal clutter. There's a doorway leading to another room (seen slightly in the top-left corner) adding a hint of depth. The doorway reveals a small portion of a differently colored room (purplish-blue).
