Generate an image of a living room with hardwood floors.  The walls are a two-toned color scheme; one wall is a teal blue and the remaining walls are a pale yellow. 


The main furniture pieces are a beige fabric couch positioned against the teal wall, a wooden coffee table in front of the couch with a dark blue glass bottle and a small green plant arrangement as a centerpiece. A wooden chair is placed in front of the coffee table, angled slightly towards the couch.  The chair has a simple, slightly rustic design, with vertical slats on the back and seat.  The chair has a light beige cushion on the seat.

To the left, partially out of view, a portion of another beige fabric couch is visible, extending into the left edge of the image, forming a partial 'L' shape with the main couch.

The floor is a warm-toned, polished hardwood floor with visible wood grain. The overall lighting is soft and natural, suggesting daytime light coming from the window. The window is visible on the right wall, with light beige curtains. The room is simple and inviting, with a slightly rustic feel contributed by the wood floor and chair. The color palette is calming, with the teal accent wall adding a pop of color against the muted beige and yellow.
