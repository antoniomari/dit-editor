Generate an image of a German Shepherd dog running on a beach in the foreground. The dog is a predominantly gray and black color, with a slightly tan underbelly. It's mid-stride, paws slightly off the ground, its body angled toward the lower right of the frame, its head turned slightly to the viewer's left.  The dog appears energetic and alert. A portion of a dark leash is barely visible.


The background is a cityscape at sunset or sunrise. The sky is a blend of dusky blues, oranges, and purples with a few fluffy clouds. A large bridge spans a body of water.  Behind the bridge, a city skyline is visible, featuring several buildings including at least one tall, rectangular building that looks like a hotel or office building.  The water in the background is relatively calm, reflecting the sky and the city lights.


The beach in the foreground is dark, composed of coarse sand or small pebbles. The dog is positioned roughly in the center of the image, near the lower third, creating a contrast between the active foreground subject and the calm, somewhat distant background. The lighting should suggest the ambient light of sunrise/sunset, casting soft shadows. The overall mood should be serene yet dynamic, capturing the contrast of the dog's movement against the stillness of the cityscape.
