Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene on an overcast day.  The style should be photorealistic, with a slightly muted color palette reflecting the subdued natural light.

The main focus is a large, relatively flat expanse of vibrant green lawn occupying the majority of the foreground and middle ground.  This lawn is slightly uneven in texture, suggesting a natural, not perfectly manicured, appearance.  In the foreground, there's a strip of pale, sandy-colored ground bordering the lawn, possibly a driveway or walkway. Scattered tufts of sparse, low-lying vegetation are visible on this sandy area.

In the mid-ground, a chain link fence runs horizontally across the frame, separating the lawn from a backyard area.  Behind the fence, a modest, single-story ranch-style house is visible.  The house is light-colored, possibly beige or light gray, with a dark brown or gray roof.  It has a relatively simple design with evenly spaced windows.  Some greenery, including bushes and possibly some trees, are partially visible around the house.  A portion of a taller, possibly wooden, fence is visible on the far right side of the house.

The background features mature deciduous trees in full leaf. Their foliage is a mix of light and dark greens, creating depth and texture.  The trees are spaced out, allowing for glimpses of the sky, which should be a muted, overcast gray, without harsh shadows or direct sunlight.  The overall lighting should be soft and diffused, with minimal contrast.

The composition should be a wide shot, with the house positioned slightly off-center, drawing the viewer's eye across the lawn. The overall feel should be peaceful and tranquil, representative of a quiet suburban neighborhood.  Avoid any overly bright or saturated colors.  The image should have a slightly cool undertone.
