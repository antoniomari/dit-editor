Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene.  The background should depict a typical American suburban backyard: a grassy lawn, a single-story house with a brown roof, some mature deciduous trees, and a chain-link fence partially visible. The house should be somewhat distant, appearing as a mid-ground element,  with the trees providing some depth. The lawn is relatively even and well-maintained, showing a slightly lighter colored patch of bare earth near the bottom-center.

In the foreground, place a young giant panda bear. The panda should be positioned slightly off-center, toward the bottom and right side of the image, sitting on the lawn.  It should appear relaxed and somewhat hunched, not actively doing anything. The panda's fur should be realistically detailed; the black and white patches distinct and its texture soft. The lighting should be consistent with the natural lighting in the backyard scene, casting slight shadows to enhance realism.

The overall interaction is one of juxtaposition â€“ a wild animal in a domesticated environment. The scene should be photorealistic, not cartoonish, aiming for a slightly surreal but believable effect.  The addition of the panda should not visually detract from the details of the backyard, maintaining a clear sense of the original scene.
