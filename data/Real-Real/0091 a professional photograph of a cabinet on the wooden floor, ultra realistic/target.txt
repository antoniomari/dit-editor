Generate an image of a room with hardwood floors. The walls are a light beige, and there are gold-colored curtains flanking a large window that lets in a lot of natural light.  To the right of the window is a tall, narrow bookcase filled with books. A guitar leans against it.  A dark-colored piece of furniture, possibly a small sofa or chaise lounge, sits near the bottom right corner of the image. A red rug partially covers the floor.  In the left foreground, a large easel is visible, partially obscuring the view of what appears to be a piece of artwork. A vintage-style television sits on a wooden stand near the bottom left.


The foreground element is a two-drawer dresser, light green with off-white drawers and light-colored handles. It's positioned centrally in the room, about halfway between the window and the bookcase, but closer to the window. It stands on the hardwood floor and doesn't interact directly with any other objects, remaining independent in its space. The dresser is slightly smaller than the television stand. Its addition to the scene creates a more furnished and homey feel than the original scene, making the room feel complete. The style of the dresser is mid-century modern or retro.  The lighting in the image should be somewhat dim, reflecting the ambient lighting in the original image.
