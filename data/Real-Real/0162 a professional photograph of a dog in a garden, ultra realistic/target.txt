Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene. The background should consist of a well-maintained lawn, a single-story house with a light-brown roof and light-colored siding, several mature deciduous trees providing shade, and a chain-link fence bordering the property. The grass should be a vibrant green, and the trees should have full, lush foliage, suggesting a spring or summer setting.  The house should appear clean and tidy.

In the foreground, add a tricolor Australian Shepherd puppy. It should be positioned in the bottom center of the image, lying down on the lawn near a patch of bare, light brown earth. The puppy should be looking directly at the viewer, with a slightly playful expression. Its fur should be predominantly white, with black patches on its head and back and some brown markings. It should be wearing a light blue collar.

The puppy should be in sharp focus, while the background should be slightly softer in focus to create a depth of field effect. The overall lighting should be soft and natural, suggestive of an outdoor scene on a slightly cloudy day.  The addition of the puppy should not significantly alter the overall ambiance of the backyard scene; it should rather add a sense of calmness and domesticity.  The puppy should be seamlessly integrated into the scene, as if it naturally belongs there.
