Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene, shot from a slightly low angle.  The style should be photorealistic, with a slightly muted color palette.

**Scene:** The foreground is dominated by a patch of dry, light brown-tan earth, sparsely dotted with small, green weeds or grass. This transitions into a large expanse of vibrant, but not overly saturated, green lawn that extends to the middle ground.  In the middle ground, a modest single-story house with a brown pitched roof is visible. The house appears to be made of light-colored brick or siding and has a few visible windows.  The house sits slightly back from the lawn, nestled amongst mature deciduous trees that are mostly in leaf but with the leaves not densely packed, suggesting it's either spring or early summer.  A chain link fence runs along the edge of the property. To the left of the house, there's a partially visible taller structure that could be a shed or a part of a taller fence with some light teal or blue-green color visible.  There are some small shrubs and bushes scattered around the base of the house and between the trees.

**Lighting:** The lighting should be soft, diffused natural light, indicative of an overcast day or soft morning/late afternoon light. There are no harsh shadows.  The overall mood should be calm and peaceful.

**Composition:** The composition should be relatively simple, with the focus on the contrast between the foreground dry earth and the lush green lawn and the house in the background. The house should be centrally located but not perfectly in the center. The trees provide a natural frame around the house, but don't obscure the view. The perspective should give a sense of depth, making the house look further away and slightly smaller than it actually is.

**Overall:** The image should convey a sense of quiet suburban life, with a slightly unkempt but peaceful feeling.  Avoid overly bright or vibrant colors; maintain a realistic, slightly muted tone.  The overall image resolution should be high, allowing for details in the foliage and the texture of the earth and grass to be clearly visible.
