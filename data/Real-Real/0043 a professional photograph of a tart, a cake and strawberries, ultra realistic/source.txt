Generate a photorealistic image of a slice of tiramisu cake on a white plate, surrounded by fresh strawberries.

**Scene:** The scene is a simple, elegant close-up shot of a dessert.  The focus is sharply on the tiramisu slice and the strawberries immediately surrounding it, with a shallow depth of field blurring the background slightly. The plate is a simple, clean white, rectangular plate. The background is a softly blurred, neutral beige. A hint of a patterned surface (possibly a mug) is visible out-of-focus in the upper right corner.

**Cake:** The tiramisu is a triangular slice, showing two distinct layers of coffee-soaked ladyfingers between layers of creamy mascarpone. The top is covered with a glossy, almost gelatinous layer that reflects light slightly, with a visible dark coffee bean embedded near the top. The layering is clearly visible, showing a slight textural difference between the layers. The cake looks moist and decadent.

**Strawberries:**  Fresh, ripe strawberries surround the tiramisu on the plate. They're arranged somewhat casually, with some overlapping others, adding a natural, appealing look.  The strawberries are bright red, with a slight sheen indicating freshness.  Their texture should be detailed showing the individual seeds.

**Lighting:** The lighting is soft and diffused, preventing harsh shadows. The light appears to be coming from slightly above and in front of the scene, highlighting the glossy top of the tiramisu and the shiny surfaces of the strawberries. The overall mood is warm and inviting, emphasizing the deliciousness of the dessert.

**Style:** The style is clean, minimalist, and photorealistic. The image should resemble a high-quality food photograph, focusing on accurate color representation and texture detail. The overall aesthetic is one of simple elegance and appetizing appeal.

**Composition:** The tiramisu slice is positioned slightly off-center, creating a visually balanced composition. The strawberries are arranged around it, creating a natural frame that draws the eye to the cake. The simple white plate provides a clean background that contrasts beautifully with the warm colors of the dessert and the bright red strawberries.  The depth of field should be shallow, ensuring the cake and surrounding strawberries are in crisp focus while the background softly fades out.
