Generate an image of a calm waterfront scene at sunset or sunrise. The background should feature a long, modern bridge spanning a wide river or bay.  The bridge should be a muted grey-blue color, and the sky should be a blend of pastel pinks, oranges, and blues with soft, fluffy clouds. Behind the bridge, a city skyline is visible, including several mid-rise buildings, primarily silhouetted against the sky. The water should be relatively calm, reflecting the colors of the sky and bridge. The overall lighting should be soft and even, suggesting the golden hour.

In the foreground, a fluffy, light brown Cockapoo dog is placed slightly off-center, closer to the bottom left. The dog should be walking or trotting towards the viewer, its tongue slightly out.  Its fur should be detailed and realistically textured. The dog is positioned on a sandy or gravelly beach, immediately adjacent to the water's edge. The texture of the beach should be visible and contrast subtly with the dog's fur. The dog should not appear to be superimposed harshly; rather, it should look naturally integrated into the scene.  The beach should extend from the bottom edge of the frame to the water's edge, creating a clear separation between the water and land. The overall tone of the image should be serene and peaceful.  The focus should be shared between the dog and the overall atmospheric beauty of the waterfront scene. The image should have a slightly desaturated look, emphasizing the calm atmosphere, but maintaining rich colors in the sky and dogâ€™s fur.
