Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene on an overcast day.

**Scene:** The main focus is a large, well-maintained lawn of a light to medium green hue, taking up the majority of the foreground and middle ground. The lawn extends from the bottom edge of the frame to approximately two-thirds of the way up.  A sandy or light-brown patch of sparsely vegetated ground occupies the bottom foreground.  Beyond the lawn, in the background, sits a single-story, light-brown ranch-style house with visible windows and a slightly gabled roof. The house looks somewhat dated, perhaps 1950s-1970s in style.  To the left of the house is a partially visible section of a chain-link fence enclosing a smaller yard. A short green structure, possibly a shed or playhouse, is partly visible behind the fence near the house.  Mature, leafy deciduous trees of various sizes and shapes populate the background and line the edges of the property, their leaves a mix of light and dark greens, suggestive of spring or early summer.  There's a suggestion of other houses and structures partially visible through the trees to the left and right. A power line runs horizontally across the mid-ground behind the trees.

**Lighting:** The scene is lit by soft, diffused daylight, typical of an overcast sky.  There are no harsh shadows; the lighting is even and relatively flat across the scene. The overall tone is muted and slightly cool, with minimal contrast between light and shadow.

**Style:** The style should be photorealistic, aiming for a slightly documentary or observational feel, without any artistic enhancements or stylization.  The image should have a slightly grainy or muted texture, as if captured by a digital camera on a slightly overcast day.  Avoid overly saturated colors or overly sharp details.

**Composition:** The image should be a wide shot, encompassing a significant portion of the backyard and the surrounding landscape. The house should be positioned somewhat centrally in the background but off-center. The lawn should dominate the composition, drawing the eye from the foreground up towards the house. The trees should frame the house and provide a sense of depth and scale. The overall perspective should be from a relatively low viewpoint, as if taken from ground level.
