Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene on an overcast day.  The style should be photorealistic, with a slightly muted color palette.

The scene's central focus is a large, verdant lawn stretching from the foreground to a mid-ground where a one-story house is visible. The house is a light beige or tan color, with a simple, slightly gabled roof.  The house has several windows, and minimal landscaping is immediately surrounding it. A short section of a wooden fence is partially visible in front of the house.  There's a hint of what looks like a patio area or grill behind the house.

In the foreground, a patch of light brown, sandy soil is visible, indicating perhaps a less-maintained or drier area near the edge of the lawn.   This sandy area occupies about the lower third of the image. The rest of the scene is the green lawn.

The background features a variety of mature deciduous trees, mostly green with varying shades indicating some leaf density differences.  The trees are spaced throughout the background, providing a natural frame for the house.  Some power lines are subtly visible running across the scene at a slight height between the trees and the house.

The lighting is soft and diffused, typical of an overcast day. There are no harsh shadows, and the overall illumination is even across the scene. The overall composition is a wide shot, with the focus on the lawn and house, framed by the trees.  The feel is calm, tranquil, and slightly understated.  The image should have a natural, unedited look, without any overly saturated or artificial color effects.
