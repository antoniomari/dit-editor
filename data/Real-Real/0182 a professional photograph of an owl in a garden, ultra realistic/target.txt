Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene. The background should depict a typical suburban landscape: a single-story house with a brown roof, surrounded by a well-maintained lawn. Mature trees and a chain-link fence are visible. The grass should be a lush, vibrant green.

In the foreground, place a snowy owl.  The owl should be positioned slightly off-center, facing the viewer, and sitting on a patch of light brown, sandy-looking soil in the middle of the grass.  The owl should be sharply focused and appear realistic, with detailed feathers showing its distinctive white and black markings. It should be positioned approximately one-third of the way up from the bottom edge of the image.  The owl's presence should subtly alter the feel of the scene; while the backyard remains primarily peaceful, the owl introduces a sense of unexpected wildness and wonder. The lighting should be consistent across the entire image, matching the natural daylight of the backyard scene, avoiding harsh shadows on the owl.
