Generate an image of a tranquil waterfront scene at sunset or sunrise.  The scene is dominated by a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water.  The bridge is a muted grey or dark charcoal color, with a flat, wide deck and supporting pillars visible beneath.  Several smaller buildings and structures are visible along the far shore, clustered near the bridge's base.  One notable building is a tall, rectangular skyscraper, somewhat dark in silhouette against the lighter sky.

The sky is the focal point of the color palette. It's a dramatic blend of soft pastels and deeper blues and purples. The sky should show a transition between the warmer tones of sunset/sunrise at the horizon and cooler tones higher up.  There are visible clouds, mostly stratus or cumulus, subtly textured and not overly dense. The light should be soft and diffused, avoiding harsh shadows.

In the foreground, there is a sandy beach stretching across the bottom third of the image. The sand is a dark grayish-brown, coarse-textured, with small pebbles and possibly some small white shells or debris scattered sparsely across it. The sand should be in sharp focus in the immediate foreground, gradually blurring slightly towards the water. The water itself should be a calm, dark, reflective surface, showing a blurred reflection of the bridge and sky.

The overall style should evoke a sense of serenity and calmness, possibly with a slightly vintage or film-like feel. The color grading should be realistic but slightly desaturated, leaning toward a muted, natural tone. The composition should be a wide shot, with the bridge as the central element and the beach leading the eye towards it. The aspect ratio should be approximately 16:9 or similar.  The overall mood should feel peaceful and contemplative.
