Generate an image of a cityscape at sunset, with a calm body of water in the foreground.  The sky should be a blend of soft pastel oranges and purples at the horizon, transitioning to deeper blues and grays higher up.  The clouds are somewhat dramatic but not stormy, with a mixture of fluffy and darker, more textured clouds.

In the background, position a long, multi-span bridge stretching across the width of the image.  Beyond the bridge, place a cityscape featuring several modern and older buildings. One building is a prominent, somewhat tall rectangular structure. The buildings should appear in silhouette against the sunset.

In the foreground, on a dark sandy beach bordering the water, place a grayscale image of a seal. The seal should be positioned slightly off-center, looking towards the viewer.  It should be rendered realistically, showing texture in its fur. The seal appears slightly out of place, contrasting with the realistic color of the background scene.  There should be a subtle blend where the seal meets the beach, but it shouldn't be completely seamless; a slight cut-and-paste effect is acceptable. The seal should be roughly one-third to one-half the size of the bridge in the background.  The water should reflect the sky and the cityscape subtly.  The overall lighting should be consistent with a sunset scene, with the scene illuminated by the warm tones of the setting sun, but the seal should remain in grayscale.
