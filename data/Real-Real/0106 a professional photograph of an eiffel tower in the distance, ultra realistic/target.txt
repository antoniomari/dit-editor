Generate an image of a rocky, mountainous landscape under a bright blue sky.  The background should feature a relatively flat expanse of pale green and brown vegetation, possibly scrubland or grassland, extending to rolling hills in the middle distance and a slightly darker, more forested hill in the background.  The terrain should appear dry and arid.  A section of light gray or tan rock formations, possibly ruins or ancient stone structures, dominates the immediate foreground.  The rocks are irregularly shaped and sized, varying in texture from smooth and worn to rough and jagged.

Superimposed onto this background, and positioned slightly off-center toward the right, is a light brown teddy bear. The bear is sitting amongst the rocks, slightly turned toward the viewer.  It appears to be a plush, slightly worn teddy bear, with visible texture in its fur.  It should be realistically sized relative to the rocks; approximately 10-15 inches tall.  A small, dark blue detail (possibly a tag or ribbon) is around its neck.

In the background, further away than the hills, a semi-transparent, cyan-colored Eiffel Tower is subtly superimposed. It should be smaller in scale than the hills, almost appearing as a faint apparition, and positioned above the distant horizon, in line with the midpoint of the image.  The transparency ensures the background landscape is still visible through the tower, making the effect surreal.  The overall lighting should be consistent across the entire scene, creating a seamless blend between the real and surreal elements.  The style should be photorealistic, with a slight sense of whimsical surrealism imparted by the Eiffel Tower's placement and transparency.
