Generate an image of a light brown teddy bear sitting on a rocky outcrop overlooking a vast landscape.

**Scene:** The teddy bear is the focal point, positioned slightly off-center in the foreground.  It's seated on a rough, uneven surface composed of grey and brown rocks of varying sizes and shapes. Some rocks are large and flat, others are smaller and more rounded. The ground texture should appear dry and possibly dusty. The background features a rolling landscape of pale green and brown hills under a clear, bright blue sky.  A distant line of cliffs or rock formations is visible in the mid-ground, suggesting a canyon or valley.  A small, indistinct flagpole is visible in the distance to the left.

**Lighting:** The scene is brightly lit, indicative of a sunny day. The light is natural and even, casting minimal shadows.  The teddy bear is well-illuminated.

**Style:** The overall style should be photorealistic, with a slightly muted color palette. The textures of the rocks and the teddy bear's fur should be clearly defined. The image should have a somewhat serene and peaceful atmosphere.

**Composition:** The image should have a wide angle, capturing both the teddy bear and the extensive background landscape. The depth of field should allow both the foreground (teddy bear and rocks) and background (hills and sky) to be in focus. The rule of thirds composition is suggested, with the teddy bear placed slightly off-center to create visual interest.


**Teddy Bear Details:** The teddy bear is a relatively simple design,  light brown or tan, with a slightly worn or slightly fuzzy appearance. It's sitting upright with its legs slightly apart and its arms relaxed to its sides. It has a small, dark blue or black detail around its neck, possibly a tag or ribbon.  The bear's features are simple but clearly defined.

The overall image should convey a sense of adventure, tranquility, and perhaps a feeling of loneliness or solitude, while simultaneously presenting a comforting element with the bear.
