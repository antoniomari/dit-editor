Generate an image of a white plate containing several golden-brown spring rolls arranged somewhat haphazardly.  The spring rolls vary slightly in size and shape, suggesting they're homemade, not perfectly uniform. Some are partially overlapping others.  They appear crispy and slightly oily.

In the background, but still prominently featured, is a small white ramekin containing a dark reddish-brown sauce, possibly soy sauce or a sweet chili sauce. To the far left, a garnish of shredded carrots and lettuce is visible, partially obscuring the bottom of the plate.


The foreground element is a metallic teaspoon, positioned vertically, resting among the spring rolls toward the right side of the plate. The spoon is shiny and reflects a bit of light; it's somewhat stylized in appearance but realistic.  It doesn't appear to be touching any of the spring rolls directly but is nestled very closely within the group. The spoon is the main point of focus, even though the spring rolls and sauce are the central subjects of the plate.


The overall scene is warm and inviting, suggestive of an appetizing Asian-inspired meal. The addition of the spoon alters the scene slightly, adding a sense of impromptu preparation or casual dining, perhaps suggesting the spring rolls are freshly prepared and about to be eaten. The lighting should be soft and natural, enhancing the textures of the food and the shine of the spoon. The composition should be slightly off-center, with the spoon breaking the symmetry of the spring rolls.
