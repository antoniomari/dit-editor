Generate an image of a close-up shot of a plate of golden-brown spring rolls arranged artfully on a white plate. The spring rolls should have a slightly crisp texture, and their surfaces should show subtle variations in color, suggesting they've been freshly fried.  There should be a small, white ramekin in the background, filled with a dark reddish-brown dipping sauce.  To the left of the ramekin, a garnish of shredded green lettuce and julienned carrots provides a vibrant contrast in color and texture.  The lighting should be soft and diffused, avoiding harsh shadows, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.  The overall style should be naturalistic and appetizing, reminiscent of food photography in a restaurant setting. The perspective should be slightly elevated, as if looking down at the plate from a comfortable angle. The plate should be bright white, clean and simple.  The background should be subtly blurred, with a hint of a light wood table visible, keeping the focus firmly on the food. The overall composition should feel balanced and visually appealing, emphasizing the texture and colors of the food. The image should be high resolution, capturing detail clearly.
