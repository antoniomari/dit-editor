Generate a photorealistic image of a suburban backyard scene on a slightly overcast day.  The style should be naturalistic, with a focus on accurate representation of light and shadow.

The main focus is a large, expansive lawn of bright, somewhat uneven, green grass.  This lawn occupies the majority of the foreground and midground, extending from the bottom of the frame to about two-thirds of the way up.  The grass shows subtle variations in color and texture, suggesting some minor patches of slightly drier or thinner grass.

In the midground, a portion of the lawn closest to the viewer is bordered by a section of bare, sandy or light-brown dirt, which occupies the very bottom of the frame. Scattered sparse, small weeds or plants are visible on this bare patch.

The background features a one-story residential house with a brown shingle roof. The house is set back from the lawn, and some leafy green shrubs and trees partially obscure its view. The house is a simple, slightly muted light-brown or beige, and appears to have several windows.

Surrounding the house and lawn are mature deciduous trees with full green leaves. The trees are somewhat varied in type, creating a lush and shaded backdrop. A chain-link fence is partially visible behind and to the side of the house, suggesting a property boundary. The overall lighting is soft and diffused, indicative of an overcast sky.  There are subtle shadows cast by the trees, but no harsh shadows. The overall color palette is natural and subdued, with greens, browns, and light beige tones dominating. The scene should feel peaceful and somewhat tranquil.
