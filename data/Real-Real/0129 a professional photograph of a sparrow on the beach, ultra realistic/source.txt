Generate an image of a coastal scene at sunset or sunrise.  The main focus is a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water. The bridge should be a muted grey or dark grey, almost silhouetted against the sky.  It has a fairly flat, horizontal design with multiple spans and supports.  There are some smaller buildings and structures visible along the far shore near the bridge, but they're not sharply defined.  One building, on the right side, should stand out as a taller, rectangular structure;  a muted dark grey, similar in tone to the bridge.

In the foreground, there is a sandy beach with a shallow depth of field, making the sand appear in sharp focus while the background, including the water and bridge, is slightly less sharp. The sand texture should be visible; small pebbles and grains are okay.  The water in the foreground should have a slight blurring effect, suggesting a long exposure to capture the movement of the water. The reflection of the sky and bridge should be visible but subtly diffused in the water.

The sky is the most dramatic element.  It should be a captivating blend of warm and cool tones.  There are streaks of pink and orange near the horizon, indicative of sunrise or sunset, blending into cooler blues and greys higher up.  The clouds should be a mix of fluffy cumulus clouds and long, sweeping stratus clouds, creating a dynamic and textured sky. The overall lighting is soft and diffused, avoiding harsh shadows.

The style should be realistic, aiming for a tranquil, slightly melancholic, and evocative atmosphere. The color palette should be muted, with a dominance of greys, blues, and soft warm tones from the sky. The overall composition should be a wide shot, emphasizing the expansive sky and the long bridge stretching across the water. The viewpoint is from a low angle, near the beach, looking towards the bridge and the cityscape in the distance.
