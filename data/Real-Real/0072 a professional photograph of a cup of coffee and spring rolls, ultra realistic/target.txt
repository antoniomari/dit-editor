Generate an image of a white plate holding a pile of golden-brown spring rolls.  The spring rolls are arranged somewhat haphazardly, overlapping each other.  They are oblong, slightly curved, and have a crispy texture implied by their appearance.  

In the foreground, slightly behind and to the left of the center of the spring rolls, is a small white ceramic espresso cup.  The cup is about two-thirds full of dark brown espresso. The cup has the word "Cubana" written on it in a simple sans-serif font. The text is dark gray or black, and the word "cafe" is written above "Cubana" in a much smaller font. The cup casts a subtle shadow on the plate.


To the upper left of the cup is a small garnish of shredded carrots and green lettuce. The garnish is partially obscured by the cup and spring rolls.

The overall lighting is soft and even, with no harsh shadows. The background is blurred and indistinct, suggesting a cafe setting. The scene is clean, bright, and appetizing.  The spring rolls and coffee cup are the clear focal point. The whole composition is designed to be inviting and suggest a simple cafe meal.
