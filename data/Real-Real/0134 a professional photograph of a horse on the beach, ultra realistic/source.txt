Generate an image depicting a tranquil waterfront scene at sunset.  The style should be photorealistic, with a slightly muted and desaturated color palette, emphasizing a calm, peaceful mood.

**Foreground:** The foreground consists of a gently sloping sandy beach, composed of fine, dark-grey sand with small, light-colored pebbles and debris scattered sparsely across the surface. The texture should be clearly visible, showing the individual grains of sand. The focus should be slightly shallow, with the sand in sharp focus in the immediate foreground gradually softening into a gentle blur towards the water.

**Midground:** The midground is a calm, still body of water, reflecting the sky and the bridge in a somewhat blurred manner suggesting a long exposure. The water's surface is dark and smooth, with subtle ripples and reflections.

**Background:** The background features a long, modern bridge stretching across the water. The bridge is a dark grey or black silhouette against a pastel sunset sky.  Buildings are visible in the distance beyond the bridge; one is a prominent, rectangular high-rise building appearing dark against the sky.  Other smaller structures are less distinct.

**Sky:** The sky is a dramatic mix of clouds, with soft pastel hues of pink, orange, and yellow near the horizon, blending into cooler blues and greys higher up. The clouds are mostly cumulus and stratus types, with variations in density and texture creating visual interest.  The light should be soft and diffused, suggesting either early evening or late dawn.

**Lighting:** The overall lighting should be soft and even, with the most intense light coming from the horizon near the setting sun.  The light should illuminate the sky and clouds with a gentle glow, casting long shadows from the bridge and buildings, but overall maintaining a calm and peaceful atmosphere.  Avoid harsh shadows.

**Composition:** The composition should follow a classic foreground-midground-background structure. The sandy beach in the foreground draws the eye towards the bridge and city in the background, with the calm water acting as a seamless transition between the two. The bridge should be positioned slightly off-center to create a more dynamic composition. The aspect ratio should be roughly landscape orientation.
