Generate an image of a dark brown horse standing on a dark, gravelly beach. The horse is facing to the left of the frame, its head slightly lowered. Its coat is a rich, dark brown with a lighter, almost blonde, tail. The horse is positioned slightly off-center, towards the left third of the frame.

The background is a cityscape at sunset or sunrise.  A long, multi-span bridge stretches across the width of the image in the middle distance, with a calm body of water separating it from the beach. Beyond the bridge is a cityscape featuring buildings of varying heights, including a prominent, relatively tall, rectangular building slightly to the right of center. The sky is a mixture of clouds, with warmer colors of sunset/sunrise visible on the horizon, contrasting with cooler blues and grays higher in the sky. The overall lighting suggests a twilight hour.  The water is relatively calm, reflecting the sky and cityscape.

The horse appears to be solitary and slightly out of place within the urban background, creating a contrast between the natural and the man-made. There's a peaceful, slightly surreal quality to the composition due to the juxtaposition of the horse and the cityscape. The gravel of the beach extends from the water's edge towards the bottom of the frame. The resolution should be high enough to show detail in both the horse's coat and the cityscape.
