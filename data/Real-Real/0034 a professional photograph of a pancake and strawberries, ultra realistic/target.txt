Generate an image of a white plate containing several ripe strawberries arranged around a large, golden-brown pancake.

**Foreground:** The main focus is a single, large pancake, occupying the central-upper portion of the plate.  Itâ€™s roughly oval, slightly irregular in shape, and has a distinct heart shape subtly imprinted on its surface, possibly from drizzled syrup. The pancake's texture should be visibly fluffy and slightly browned.  It appears slightly glossy, indicating moisture.  The edges should appear soft and slightly irregular.

**Background:** The background is a white plate, clean and simple. Surrounding the pancake are several whole strawberries, mostly clustered towards the lower parts of the plate and the lower left. The strawberries should be realistically rendered with their characteristic texture and slight variations in color and shine due to light reflections. Some strawberries are partially overlapping others, suggesting a natural arrangement.

**Interaction:** The pancake sits prominently on the plate, with the strawberries arranged casually around it, neither touching nor obscuring the pancake itself.  The strawberries are not uniformly distributed, with more concentrated clusters on the lower left and right, leaving some space around the pancake. The pancake appears freshly made and the strawberries look ripe and juicy, reflecting light naturally. There should be no shadows obscuring the strawberries and pancake.  The entire scene is lit softly and evenly. The overall scene is simple, clean, and conveys a sense of freshness and appetizing quality.
