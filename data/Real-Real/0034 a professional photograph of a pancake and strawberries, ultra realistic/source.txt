Generate a photorealistic image of a slice of tiramisu cake on a white rectangular plate, surrounded by fresh strawberries.

**Scene:** The scene is simple and elegant, focusing on the dessert. A single, generous slice of tiramisu is the centerpiece.  The cake has two distinct layers of coffee-soaked ladyfingers visible between layers of creamy mascarpone cheese. The top is coated with a glossy, transparent glaze, with a visible coffee bean embedded in it.  Several ripe, red strawberries are arranged artfully around the cake slice on the plate.  The strawberries are glossy and show individual details like seeds and slight imperfections in their surfaces, indicating freshness.

**Lighting:** The lighting is soft and diffused, minimizing harsh shadows.  The light source appears to be coming from slightly above and to the front, highlighting the glossy surface of the cake and the juicy texture of the strawberries.  There is a gentle reflection on the plate and the glaze of the cake.

**Style:** The overall style is clean, minimalist, and food photography-oriented. The focus is on showcasing the dessert in an appealing way, with a calm and sophisticated mood.  The image should have a shallow depth of field, gently blurring the background to emphasize the cake and strawberries.

**Composition:** The tiramisu slice is positioned slightly off-center, creating a visually balanced composition.  The strawberries are arranged asymmetrically, but in a way that complements the cake slice's placement. The white plate provides a stark contrast against the rich brown of the cake and the deep red of the strawberries, drawing the viewer's eye to the dessert. The background should be softly blurred and out of focus, possibly a neutral, light-colored background or a suggestion of a table setting without sharp details. The overall impression should be one of deliciousness and simple elegance.
