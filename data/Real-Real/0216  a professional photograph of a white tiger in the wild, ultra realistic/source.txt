Generate a landscape image in a soft, slightly hazy, Impressionistic style.  The scene should be a gently sloping hillside leading to a background of a dark green forest.

**Foreground:** The foreground is dominated by a pale green, slightly overgrown grassy path that meanders from the bottom center to the middle ground.  Wildflowers in muted yellows and oranges are sparsely scattered throughout the foreground grass, creating a feeling of natural untamed beauty. The grass is varied in height and texture, not perfectly manicured.

**Midground:** The path curves gently upwards through a field of tall, light-green grass.  A small cluster of reddish-brown bushes or small trees is situated near the middle of the scene, just before the path starts to climb into the background. This area should be slightly more saturated in color compared to the overall soft tones.

**Background:** The background is a dense forest of dark evergreens on a hillside. The trees are slightly blurred, implying depth of field and creating a sense of distance.  The overall color palette of the forest is dark green with hints of muted browns and yellows from the sunlight filtering through the canopy. The hill is not sharply defined; the transition from the field to the forest is gradual and soft.

**Lighting:** The lighting should be soft and diffused, suggesting either an overcast day or soft morning/evening light. The overall scene should have a tranquil, peaceful mood.  The light should be slightly brighter in the midground to draw the eye to the path and central bush cluster. The use of light should help to enhance the soft hazy effect and create a gentle, atmospheric perspective.

**Style:** The image should have a slightly impressionistic style, with soft edges and visible brushstrokes (or the equivalent in a text-to-image generated image). Colors should be muted and pastel-like, avoiding harsh contrasts.  There should be a gentle vibrance in the overall scene, despite the muted tones.  The scene should be detailed enough to be recognizable but not hyperrealistic. The focus is on creating a mood and atmosphere rather than crisp, sharp details.
