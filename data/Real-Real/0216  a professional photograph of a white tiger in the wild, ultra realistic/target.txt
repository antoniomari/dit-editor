Generate an image of a lush green hillside scene, similar to a pastoral landscape, with rolling hills and a variety of green foliage. The trees are mostly evergreen, densely packed on the upper slopes, transitioning to smaller shrubs and flowering plants lower down. The overall color palette should be predominantly greens and yellows, with the greens ranging from deep forest green to lighter meadow green. The lighting should suggest a sunny day.

Into this landscape, composite a white tiger. Position the tiger slightly off-center, standing on a grassy path that gently curves through the meadow. The tiger should be facing slightly away from the camera, appearing alert but calm. It should be in focus, while the background remains softly focused, creating a depth-of-field effect. Ensure the tiger's fur is rendered realistically, with distinct white fur and dark grey stripes.  Its eyes should be sharp and expressive.  The tiger should appear integrated into the environment, not just pasted onto the image.  The lighting on the tiger should be consistent with the overall lighting of the scene.  Avoid any jarring discontinuities in color or lighting between the tiger and the background. The overall feel should be peaceful and natural, as if the tiger is a native part of this habitat.
