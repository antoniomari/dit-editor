Generate an image of a plate of food containing several spring rolls and a small white ramekin of dipping sauce. The spring rolls are golden brown and arranged somewhat haphazardly.  A small pile of shredded carrots and lettuce is visible in the upper left corner of the plate, partially obscured by the spring rolls. The ramekin is positioned behind and slightly to the left of the center of the spring rolls.


In the foreground, partially obscuring the lower portion of the spring rolls, is a heart-shaped waffle. The waffle is golden-brown and appears to be crispy, with a slightly textured surface indicating square waffle grid patterns. The heart-shaped waffle is placed such that its bottom edge is approximately halfway down the plate, and it overlaps some of the spring rolls.  The waffle's color is a slightly deeper shade of brown than the spring rolls, but still within a similar color range. The overall lighting should be warm and inviting, focusing on the food's texture and appeal. The waffle should appear to have been freshly made. The scene should retain the original image's lighting and overall style, emphasizing the juxtaposition of the Asian-inspired spring rolls and the Western-style waffle. The background should include the visible parts of a table or counter of a light wood color.
