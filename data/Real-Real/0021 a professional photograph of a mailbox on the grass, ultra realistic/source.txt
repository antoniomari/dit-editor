Generate an image of a grey rabbit sitting in dappled sunlight under the shade of a coniferous tree.

**Scene:** The rabbit is positioned slightly off-center, facing to the right of the frame. It sits in short, slightly unkempt grass.  A large tree trunk is partially visible to the left, extending from the bottom to about the top third of the image. The tree provides dappled shade, with a significant portion of the background lit by soft sunlight. Scattered small white flowers dot the grassy area. The overall feel should be peaceful and natural.


**Lighting:** The lighting should be natural, soft, and diffused.  The sunlight should filter through the conifer branches, creating patches of light and shadow on the grass. The rabbit itself should be well-lit but not harshly so, with some subtle shadowing to define its form.


**Style:** The style should be photorealistic, aiming for a natural and slightly muted color palette. The overall image should have a serene, slightly melancholic feel.  Avoid overly saturated or vibrant colors; aim for natural tones in the greens of the grass and the grey of the rabbit's fur.  The level of detail should be high, showcasing the individual blades of grass and the rabbit's fur texture.

**Composition:** The composition should be fairly simple and straightforward, focusing on the rabbit and its immediate surroundings. The tree and the grassy area provide a natural frame for the rabbit. The depth of field should be relatively shallow, drawing focus to the rabbit while softly blurring the background.  The perspective should be from a slightly elevated viewpoint, looking down at the rabbit.
