Generate an image of a tranquil waterfront scene at sunset or sunrise.  The scene is dominated by a long, modern, multi-span bridge stretching across a calm body of water. The bridge should be a dark grey or black silhouette against the sky, emphasizing its structure and length. 


The sky should be a dramatic blend of colors.  The upper portion could be a deep blue, transitioning to a lighter, more pastel blue towards the horizon, with streaks of soft orange and pink hues near the horizon line, suggesting the glow of the setting/rising sun. The clouds should be a mix of fluffy cumulus clouds and slightly darker, more textured stratus clouds, giving a sense of depth and movement in the sky.


In the background, beyond the bridge, a few tall buildings are visible, appearing as dark silhouettes against the bright sky. One building is noticeably taller than the others, perhaps a hotel or office building, with a simple, rectangular shape. 


The foreground is a close-up view of a sandy beach or shoreline, which is relatively flat and slightly textured. The sand should have a slightly darker, brownish-grey tone. The water in the foreground should be calm, reflecting the sky and the bridge subtly, giving a smooth, almost glassy appearance, showing motion blur subtly hinting at a gentle current.


The overall style should be realistic but slightly painterly, with soft, diffused lighting to emphasize the mood of the moment. The color palette should be muted and slightly desaturated, with the warm colors of the sky serving as a contrast to the cool tones of the bridge and water. The composition should be balanced, with the bridge as the central focus, and the sky and foreground elements playing supporting roles.  The perspective should be from a low angle near the water's edge, looking out towards the bridge and the city beyond.
