Generate an image of a predominantly white and black Jack Russell Terrier-type dog standing on a dark-grey, pebbly beach.  The dog is positioned slightly off-center, more towards the left of the frame, and is facing to the left.  Itâ€™s a medium-sized dog, appearing fluffy, with its body primarily white except for a large black patch extending from its back to its tail. The dog's head is predominantly white with black markings around the ears.

The background is a landscape image featuring a long bridge spanning a calm body of water. The bridge is grey and has multiple arches.  Beyond the bridge is a cityscape with a prominent, multi-story building, appearing dark and rectangular in silhouette. The sky is a dramatic blend of cloudy sunset colors, with hues of orange, pink, and purple at the horizon gradually shifting to muted blues and greys higher up. The water reflects the sky and the city, appearing relatively still.

The dog is placed in the foreground at the beach, where it appears to be naturally integrated into the scene. There is a subtle interaction between the foreground and background; the dog's presence contrasts the serene, slightly melancholic tone of the sunset cityscape and bridge setting.  The overall feeling should be peaceful yet slightly whimsical, contrasting the calmness of the background with the playful presence of the dog.  The lighting should match that of the background image, with soft sunset light and shadows that reflect the natural conditions of the scene.  The level of detail should be high, rendering both the dog's fur texture and the details in the cityscape visible and clear.
