Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene.  The background should feature a single-story house with a brown roof, surrounded by lush green grass and mature deciduous trees.  A chain-link fence runs partially along the back edge of the yard.  The overall lighting should suggest a sunny day.


In the foreground, add a single, adult, white goat. The goat should be positioned slightly off-center, toward the left of the frame, standing on a patch of lighter-colored, slightly drier-looking grass in front of the main lawn.  The goat should appear calm and at ease, facing slightly to the left. It should be wearing a simple, dark-brown collar.

The goat should be in focus, contrasting with the slightly softer focus of the background house and trees.  The goat should not appear to interact directly with any other elements in the scene, maintaining a neutral pose.  The addition of the goat should alter the scene to be more whimsical and unexpected, suggesting a humorous juxtaposition of domestic life and unexpected animal presence.  There should be no other animals or people visible.
