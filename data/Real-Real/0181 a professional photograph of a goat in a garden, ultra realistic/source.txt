Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene on an overcast day.

**Scene:** The main focus is a large, verdant lawn occupying most of the frame.  A single-story, light brown or beige house with a dark brown roof is situated in the midground, partially obscured by lush green trees. The house appears to be a ranch style with several windows visible. To the left of the house, there's a partially visible section of a taller, darker building or fence, possibly a shed or part of a neighboring property.  A chain-link fence runs along the left side of the yard, separating the lawn from what seems to be another property or street.  There are some sparsely placed shrubs and plants visible near the house and fence. The ground in the immediate foreground is a mixture of patchy grass and light brown, sandy soil, suggesting a less-maintained area closer to the viewer.

**Lighting:** The lighting is soft and diffused, characteristic of an overcast sky. There are no harsh shadows, suggesting even illumination across the scene. The overall color palette is muted and natural, with greens, browns, and light beige dominating.

**Style:** The style should be realistic and slightly muted, resembling a photo taken on a cloudy day.  The overall mood should be calm and peaceful, with a slightly nostalgic or everyday feel. Avoid overly saturated colors or dramatic effects. The image should be sharp enough to clearly distinguish the house and trees but not overly crisp.

**Composition:** The image is taken from a low angle, possibly ground level, looking towards the house and lawn.  The lawn forms a large expanse in the middle and lower two-thirds of the frame, leading the eye towards the house. Trees are prominent in the background, framing the house and providing depth to the scene. The overall composition is horizontal and relatively wide, capturing a significant portion of the backyard.  There's a slight perspective leading the viewer's eye to the house in the middle ground.
