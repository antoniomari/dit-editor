Generate an image depicting a suburban backyard scene on an overcast day.

**Scene:** The main focus is a large, verdant lawn stretching from the foreground to a line of mature trees and a single-story house in the mid-ground.  A chain-link fence runs along the left side of the lawn, partially obscuring a portion of the neighboring yard.  Behind the fence, there's a glimpse of another house and some shrubbery.  The house in the mid-ground is a simple ranch style, light-colored, possibly beige or light brown, with visible windows. A small portion of another building is visible to the left. In the yard behind the house are some sparsely distributed bushes and other greenery.Â  The foreground is a strip of lighter-colored, possibly sandy or dry, earth leading to the lawn.

**Lighting:** The lighting should be soft and diffuse, indicative of an overcast sky. There are no harsh shadows; everything is evenly lit. The overall tone should be slightly muted and cool.

**Style:** The style should be photorealistic, aiming for a natural and un-staged look. Think "everyday suburban landscape." The image should have a slightly desaturated color palette, with greens dominating the lawn and trees, and muted earth tones in the foreground and house.

**Composition:** The image is a wide shot, with the lawn occupying the majority of the frame. The house and trees are positioned to create a sense of depth. The perspective is from slightly below eye level, looking towards the house across the lawn. The overall feel is peaceful and quiet. The perspective should be similar to a photograph taken from a slightly lower angle, looking towards the house and trees.
