Generate an image of a close-up shot of a plate of golden-brown spring rolls arranged artfully on a bright white, subtly glossy plate.  The spring rolls should have a slightly crisp texture visible.  Several are stacked slightly, others lay individually, creating a dynamic composition.


In the upper left corner, a small portion of a fresh green lettuce and shredded orange carrots salad is visible, adding a splash of vibrant color and contrasting texture.  A small, simple white ceramic ramekin containing a dark reddish-brown dipping sauce sits near the center. The sauce should appear slightly viscous.


The lighting should be soft and diffused, avoiding harsh shadows.  Aim for a style that's realistic, yet slightly stylized, with a warm and inviting feel. The overall composition should be focused on the spring rolls, with the other elements serving as complimentary background elements.  The background should be softly blurred, with a hint of a light wood-toned surface visible in the upper right corner, but not in focus.  The image should have a shallow depth of field, drawing the viewer's attention to the spring rolls in the foreground.  The overall mood should be one of appetizing deliciousness.
