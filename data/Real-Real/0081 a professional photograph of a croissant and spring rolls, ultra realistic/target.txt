Generate an image of a white plate holding several fried spring rolls and a single croissant.  

The spring rolls are golden-brown, slightly cylindrical, and arranged somewhat haphazardly across the plate.  Some are overlapping others. They appear crispy.  There's a small, white ramekin of dark brown sauce nestled amongst them.  A garnish of shredded carrots and lettuce is partially visible near the top left corner. The entire arrangement of spring rolls, sauce, and garnish occupies the upper half of the plate.

The foreground element is a single, golden-brown croissant. It is positioned towards the bottom center of the plate, partially overlapping some of the spring rolls in a natural, slightly casual manner. The croissant should be meticulously detailed, showcasing its flaky layers and slightly glossy surface. Its color should contrast warmly with the lighter spring rolls.

The background is implied by the spring rolls and sauce, establishing the context of an Asian-inspired meal. The overall lighting should be soft and even, highlighting the texture and colors of both the spring rolls and the croissant. The white plate is clean and provides a stark contrast to the food. The final image should be a still life, conveying a sense of deliciousness and casual elegance.
