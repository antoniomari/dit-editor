Generate an image of a serene waterfront scene at sunset.  The background should depict a long, modern bridge stretching across a calm body of water.  Behind the bridge, a cityscape is visible, featuring several mid-rise buildings, most notably a tall, rectangular building that stands out against the twilight sky. The sky should be a blend of soft pastel oranges and purples near the horizon, transitioning to deep blues and clouds overhead.  The water should be relatively still, reflecting the sky and the city lights subtly.

In the foreground, place a single, large, white swan resting on a sandy beach. The swan should be positioned slightly off-center, towards the bottom third of the image. It should be depicted realistically, with its feathers detailed and its posture relaxed, almost as if it is resting peacefully after a day on the water. The swan should be in sharp focus, contrasting against the slightly softer focus of the background.

The swan's placement should create a sense of tranquility and solitude, juxtaposing the bustling cityscape in the distance. The sandy beach where the swan rests should be subtly textured and lightly colored, with perhaps a few small pebbles scattered across it. The overall lighting should be soft and evocative of a peaceful sunset, emphasizing the contrast between the lively city and the tranquil swan. The swan should appear to be on a beach directly adjacent to the water's edge, close to the viewer. The water's edge should not be clearly visible, but implied by the swanâ€™s placement and slight dampness of the sand.  The image should have a slightly dreamy, almost painterly quality, with a muted color palette that emphasizes the calming atmosphere.
