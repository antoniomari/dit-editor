Generate an image of a waterfront cityscape at sunset.  The sky should be a mix of dusky blues, oranges, and purples, with fluffy clouds showing the transition between day and night.  The water should be relatively calm, reflecting the sky and cityscape.

In the foreground, centered slightly left, is a young, wrinkled elephant calf. It appears somewhat emaciated or unusually small. Its skin is a dark grayish-brown, and its trunk is long relative to its body size. The elephant is positioned on a sandy, gravelly beach that runs along the waterfront. The texture of the beach should be visible, with small pebbles and stones scattered across it.

The cityscape in the background should feature a large, modern bridge spanning a body of water.  Behind the bridge are several buildings, including a tall, rectangular skyscraper that stands out among others. This creates a contrast between the natural element (the elephant) and the artificial structures of the urban landscape.

The elephant is not interacting directly with the cityscape, but its presence in the foreground creates a surreal and unexpected juxtaposition. The overall scene should feel slightly melancholic, with a muted color palette enhancing this mood. The elephant's placement should appear somewhat out of place and unexpected, highlighting the disparity between the natural world and the urban setting.  The lighting should be consistent across the entire image, suggesting a cohesive scene rather than a simple overlay.
