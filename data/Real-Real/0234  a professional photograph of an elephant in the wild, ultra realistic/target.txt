Generate an image of a rolling green hill scene, reminiscent of a pastoral landscape. The background should feature a hillside covered in lush green vegetation, primarily consisting of various shades of green trees and shrubs.  The trees should be a mix of conifers and deciduous trees, creating a varied texture. In the mid-ground, there's a gently sloping grassy area with patches of wildflowers, mostly yellow, scattered amongst the grass. A faint dirt path meanders through the meadow towards the hill.  The overall lighting should be bright and sunny, with shadows suggesting midday.

In the foreground, place a single adult Asian elephant. The elephant should be positioned slightly off-center, standing in the grassy area near the dirt path. Its coloration should be a dark gray-brown, with visible wrinkles in its skin. The elephant's trunk should be slightly lowered, appearing relaxed.  The elephant should be slightly smaller than typical, to give the impression of realism in the context of the background. It should not appear pasted on, blending naturally with the grass and shadows. Ensure that the elephant's legs are not noticeably floating; they should appear rooted in the ground, interacting with the existing grass. The elephant should be positioned so that it does not obscure any significant background detail and that the surrounding grass appears to be gently brushed around its legs. The overall composition should emphasize the scale difference between the elephant and the landscape, with the vastness of the setting highlighting the elephant's size. The interaction between the elephant and its environment should be seamless, creating a believable composite.
