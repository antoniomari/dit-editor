Generate a photorealistic image of a slice of tiramisu cake on a white plate, surrounded by fresh strawberries.


**Scene:** The main focus is a single, generously sized slice of tiramisu. The cake should have two distinct layers of coffee-soaked ladyfingers visible, sandwiched between layers of a creamy, light-colored filling.  The top is covered with a glossy, almost transparent layer that has a hint of reddish-brown coloring underneath, suggesting coffee or perhaps a glaze. A small, dark coffee bean sits atop the glaze.  The strawberries are vibrant red, fresh-looking, and arranged casually around the cake slice on a plain white plate. Some strawberries are slightly overlapping, creating a natural, slightly scattered arrangement.


**Lighting:** Soft, diffused lighting should illuminate the scene evenly, avoiding harsh shadows. The light should enhance the glossiness of the tiramisu's topping and the juicy appearance of the strawberries.  A subtle, warm tone to the lighting would add to the appetizing quality of the image.


**Style:** The overall style should be clean, simple, and elegant, with a focus on showcasing the deliciousness of the dessert.  The image should be sharply focused, with a shallow depth of field that subtly blurs the background, keeping attention centered on the cake and strawberries.  The background should be a plain, light-colored, unblemished surface. A slightly out-of-focus portion of a light beige surface or a plain white wall might be visible in the far background.  The style is similar to food photography used for magazine features or cookbooks.


**Composition:** The cake slice should be positioned slightly off-center to create visual interest. The strawberries are arranged to form a natural border around the cake, but avoid perfect symmetry. The white plate itself should be a key element, occupying a significant portion of the frame.  The overall composition should be pleasing and balanced, guiding the viewer's eye to the tiramisu slice.
