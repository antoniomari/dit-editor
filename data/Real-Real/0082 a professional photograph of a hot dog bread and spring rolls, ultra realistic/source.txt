Generate an image of a close-up shot of a plate of crispy fried spring rolls arranged somewhat haphazardly.  The spring rolls are golden brown, with visible texture suggesting a slightly flaky exterior.  They are arranged in a small pile on a bright white plate.

To the upper left of the spring rolls, there is a small garnish of shredded carrots and some green lettuce, slightly out of focus, providing a splash of color contrast.  In the upper middle, a small, white ramekin contains a dark reddish-brown dipping sauce. The sauce should be somewhat glossy.

The lighting should be soft and diffused, minimizing harsh shadows, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere, typical of food photography.  The style should be photorealistic, with a shallow depth of field so that the spring rolls are in sharp focus, while the background and garnish are slightly blurred. The overall composition should be balanced, with the spring rolls as the central focus, and the garnish and sauce providing complementary elements.  The plate should be a clean, simple white, oval-shaped plate with slight curves and some light reflection on its surface. The background is a slightly out-of-focus, warm light brown color that suggests a wooden table.  The overall feel should be appetizing and inviting.
