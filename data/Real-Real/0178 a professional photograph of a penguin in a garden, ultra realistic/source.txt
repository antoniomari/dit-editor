Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene on a slightly overcast day.  The style should be photorealistic, with a focus on natural light and slightly muted colors.

The scene should depict a large, mostly flat lawn of a light to medium green color. The grass appears relatively well-maintained but not perfectly manicured.  A thin strip of light brown, sandy or gravelly ground runs along the bottom edge of the frame, separating the lawn from the foreground. Sparse, small weeds or grass sprouts are visible in the sandy area.

In the mid-ground, a single-story house with a brown roof is visible. The house is simple in design, appearing somewhat modest. Its walls are light-colored, possibly beige or light grey.  The house is partially obscured by mature deciduous trees with lush green leaves. The leaves are not vibrant, reflecting the slightly overcast lighting.  

To the left of the house is a section of a chain-link fence, which partially obscures a wooden fence and some greenery.  There are also some additional leafy bushes and small trees scattered around the yard and in the background.

The overall composition should be a long shot, with the focus on the lawn and the house situated slightly off-center.  The lighting should be soft and diffused, suggesting an overcast sky, without harsh shadows. The overall mood should be calm and peaceful, evoking a sense of quiet suburban life.  A few insignificant details such as a grill and a small object that could be a child's toy are visible near the house.  Power lines are slightly visible in the upper mid-ground. The overall color palette should be predominantly greens and browns, with a slightly muted and natural tone.
