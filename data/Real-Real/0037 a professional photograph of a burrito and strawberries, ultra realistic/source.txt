Generate an image of a still life featuring a slice of tiramisu cake and fresh strawberries on a white plate.


**Scene:** The main focus is a single, generous slice of tiramisu cake.  The cake has two distinct layers of coffee-soaked ladyfingers, visible beneath a thick layer of creamy, light-colored mascarpone frosting.  The top is glazed with a clear, slightly glossy coating, and a small, dark coffee bean is visible embedded near the top edge.  Surrounding the cake are several fresh, ripe strawberries, arranged artfully but somewhat casually around the cake. Some are whole, some are slightly out of focus towards the edges.  The strawberries are a deep, vibrant red with visible seeds.


**Lighting:** The lighting is soft and diffused, avoiding harsh shadows. It should create a gentle highlight on the glossy top of the cake and the juicy surfaces of the strawberries, making them look appetizing and fresh.  The overall tone should be warm and inviting, similar to soft indoor lighting.


**Style:** The style should be photorealistic, aiming for a clean and simple aesthetic, typical of food photography.  The image should be sharp and clear, focusing on the textures of the cake and the detail of the strawberries. The background should be subtly blurred, drawing attention to the cake and strawberries in the foreground.


**Composition:** The cake is centered on a simple, clean white rectangular plate. The strawberries are arranged in a loose, organic manner around the cake, creating a pleasing visual balance. The perspective is from slightly above, looking down onto the plate. The background should be a very muted, un distracting light color â€“ almost off-white to avoid competing with the food in the foreground.  The overall composition should feel elegant and inviting, emphasizing the deliciousness of the dessert.
