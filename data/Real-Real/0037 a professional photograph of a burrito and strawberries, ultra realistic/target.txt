Generate an image of a white rectangular plate holding a slice of creamy cheesecake with a dark-colored berry topping.  Surrounding the cheesecake are several fresh strawberries.  Diagonally across the cheesecake, partially obscuring it, is a long, thin, light-colored crepe or omelet. The crepe is golden-yellow in color with flecks of green herbs dispersed throughout.  The crepe should appear to be resting on the plate, not embedded in the cheesecake.  The overall lighting should be bright and even, highlighting the colors of the food items.  The image should have a slightly glossy sheen to it, mimicking the look of a food photograph. The strawberries should be arranged naturally around the cheesecake and not in a overly precise order.  The crepe should have a slightly soft, almost creamy texture in its visual appearance. The background should be a simple, unfocused, slightly off-white surface.
