Generate an image of a delicious-looking sandwich on a white plate surrounded by fresh strawberries.  

The foreground element is a cut-in-half sandwich featuring a toasted baguette as the bread.  The filling consists of thinly sliced, rosy-pink roast duck breast,  a few pieces of what looks like caramelized onions or shallots, and some dark green lettuce. The duck appears juicy and slightly glistening. The bread has a golden-brown crust and a slightly soft interior. The overall appearance of the sandwich should be appetizing and suggest a rich flavor.

The sandwich is centrally placed on a plain, bright white plate.  Arranged around the sandwich are approximately eight to ten fresh strawberries. The strawberries are a deep red color with visible seeds.  They are placed somewhat casually, not in a perfectly symmetrical pattern, but rather in a way that suggests a relaxed, informal presentation. Some strawberries are whole and others are slightly cut or showing a less-than-perfect shape. They appear ripe and juicy, providing a vibrant contrast of color and texture to the sandwich.

The background should be subtly blurred and out of focus, possibly a light-colored surface or a neutral background that doesn't compete with the sandwich and strawberries.  The overall lighting should be soft and natural, highlighting the textures and colors of both the food items.  The image should have a clean, bright aesthetic, suitable for food photography.  The focus should be sharply on the sandwich and strawberries, with the background gently fading away.
