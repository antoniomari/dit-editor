Generate an image of a delicious-looking tiramisu cake, presented on a white plate. 


**Scene:** The scene is a close-up shot of a single, generous slice of tiramisu cake on a clean, white, rectangular plate.  Surrounding the cake are several fresh, ripe strawberries, arranged artfully but casually. The strawberries vary slightly in size and orientation, adding a natural, un-staged feel. The background is a softly blurred, out-of-focus neutral background, possibly a light beige or off-white wall. A small portion of a light-colored, patterned object (possibly a ceramic container) is visible in the upper right corner. The focus is sharply on the cake and strawberries.


**Lighting:** The lighting is soft and diffused, avoiding harsh shadows. It creates a warm and inviting atmosphere, highlighting the creamy texture of the tiramisu and the glossy sheen of the strawberries. The light seems to be coming from above and slightly in front.


**Style:** The overall style is clean, minimalist, and appealingly food-focused.  The image should have a slightly elevated feel, suggesting a high-quality dessert. The photorealistic style should be emphasized.


**Cake details:** The tiramisu is layered. The visible layers show a light-brown, coffee-soaked sponge cake, interspersed with a creamy, light-colored filling. The top is covered with a translucent, light-colored glaze or topping. There is a dark, almost black, speck (likely a coffee bean) visible in the glaze.


**Strawberry details:** The strawberries should look glossy and juicy, with visible seeds and a deep red color.


**Composition:** The cake is centered but not perfectly positioned; the offsetting slightly towards the left adds to the relaxed feel. The strawberries are arranged to complement the cake, creating a visual balance. The off-white plate provides a clean contrast against both the cake and strawberries. The shallow depth of field helps to emphasize the cake as the main subject.

The overall image should evoke a sense of elegance and deliciousness, with a focus on the fresh, natural appeal of the ingredients.
