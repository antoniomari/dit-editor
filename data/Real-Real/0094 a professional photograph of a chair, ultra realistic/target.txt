Generate an image of a living room with hardwood floors.  The walls are a light beige and feature framed artwork, including several smaller prints arranged in a row on one wall.  There is a white brick fireplace on one side of the room, with a dark metal fire screen partially obscuring the hearth.  Next to the fireplace is a simple, dark brown wooden bench.  

The focal point is a reddish-brown recliner placed centrally in the room, slightly in front of a doorway leading to another room. This doorway reveals a glimpse of a small kitchen or pantry area with white cabinets. A floor lamp is positioned to the left of the recliner.  A flat-screen TV is visible on a cabinet-like stand behind the recliner.  A fluffy white rug is partially visible under and in front of the recliner.  The overall lighting is soft and slightly muted. The ceiling has a ceiling fan.  The style is mid-century modern or transitional.
