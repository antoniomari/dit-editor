Generate an image of a cozy living room in a mid-century modern style.

**Scene:** The scene is a living room with hardwood floors, featuring a wooden entertainment center with a vintage television, a stereo system, and flanking speakers.  A fluffy white rug sits in the center of the room in front of the entertainment center. To the right, there's a simple wooden bench positioned next to a white brick fireplace with a black metal fire screen.  A small, built-in shelving unit on the wall beside the fireplace displays jars and small items. The wall opposite the fireplace features three framed nature-themed prints, hung at eye level.  A floor lamp stands to the left of the entertainment center.  An open doorway reveals a small kitchen or pantry, with white cabinets and shelves containing various items.  Small framed prints and artwork adorn various walls.

**Lighting:** The lighting should be soft and warm, suggesting natural light coming from a window just out of frame, possibly in the kitchen area. The floor lamp casts a gentle glow onto the living room. The overall ambiance should be calming and inviting.

**Style:** The style should be mid-century modern, with a slightly rustic touch. The color palette should be muted and warm, with natural wood tones (light to medium brown), off-white walls, and subtle hints of other neutral colors.

**Composition:** The composition should be balanced. The viewer's eye should naturally move across the room, taking in the details of the entertainment center, the fireplace, the kitchen glimpse, and the rug. The open doorway should be a focal point, creating depth and leading the eye further into the scene.  The three framed prints should be evenly spaced on the wall.  The overall feel should be one of comfortable simplicity.  The image should be taken from an eye-level perspective, to make the viewer feel as if they are standing in the room.


Additional details:

* The ceiling should have a ceiling fan, as shown in the reference image.
* The hardwood flooring should be light-colored wood, showing subtle variations in tone.
* The walls should have a slightly textured finish, appearing neither completely smooth nor heavily textured.
* The wood of the furniture should show its grain, adding to the rustic feel.  Avoid overly polished or glossy finishes.


The overall image should feel inviting, lived-in, and comfortable, like a cherished family space.
