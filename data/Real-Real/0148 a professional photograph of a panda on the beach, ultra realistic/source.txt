Generate an image of a tranquil waterfront scene at sunset or sunrise. 


**Scene:** The main focus is a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water.  The bridge is relatively flat and wide, with multiple arches or supports visible underneath. On the far side of the bridge is a city skyline, featuring at least one tall, rectangular building that looks like a hotel or office building, and several smaller buildings. To the foreground is a sandy beach or shoreline, stretching from the bottom edge of the image towards the water.  The beach appears relatively flat and composed of small, dark-colored pebbles or sand. A few small boats or vessels are subtly visible near the bridge on the water.


**Lighting:** The lighting should evoke either a sunset or sunrise.  The sky should display a blend of warm colors like oranges and yellows near the horizon, gradually transitioning to cooler blues and purples higher up. The clouds are mostly a mixture of lighter and darker shades, with some areas showing more dramatic, cumulus-type formations. The bridge and buildings should be somewhat silhouetted against the bright sky, with the sun being below the horizon or just barely above it. The water should reflect the colors of the sky, with a slightly blurred or long-exposure effect to indicate smooth movement.


**Style:** The overall style should be realistic but with a slightly muted or desaturated color palette.  The image should have a peaceful and serene atmosphere. The focus is on the landscape and architecture, with a subtle sense of calm and stillness. Aim for a high level of detail in the textures of the sand and the clouds but keep the overall effect relatively soft and not overly sharp. The long exposure effect on the water is a key element, lending a sense of tranquility.


**Composition:** The image should be horizontally oriented, with the bridge running roughly parallel to the bottom edge of the frame. The shoreline occupies the foreground, providing a leading line into the scene. The bridge acts as a central element leading the eye to the city skyline in the background. The overall scene should be balanced and visually appealing, with a clear distinction between the foreground, midground (bridge and water), and background (city). The ratio of the sky to the water and land should be roughly equal or slightly more sky.
