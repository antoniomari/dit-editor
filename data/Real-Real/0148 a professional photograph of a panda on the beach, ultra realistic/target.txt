Generate an image of a cityscape at sunset, specifically focusing on a long bridge spanning a wide body of water.  The sky should be a blend of sunset oranges and purples, with dark, brooding clouds.  In the background, a city skyline is visible, featuring several high-rise buildings, with at least one prominent, tall rectangular building. The bridge is a dark gray or black color and stretches across the entire width of the image.  The water under the bridge should reflect the sky and the city lights in a subtle way. The water should be relatively calm, showing some gentle ripples. The shore should be a sandy, light brown beach.

In the foreground, position a giant panda.  The panda should be sitting or lying down on the sandy beach, near the water's edge.  The panda should be realistically rendered, exhibiting high detail in its fur and facial features.  It should appear as if it is relaxed and comfortable on the beach, slightly turned towards the viewer, and not overtly interacting with the city in a way that feels out of place.  The size of the panda should be relatively large in comparison to the overall scale of the image, creating a humorous juxtaposition. Ensure there's a slight blurring of the panda, giving it a sense of depth.  Make sure the panda doesn't obstruct the view of the city, allowing the skyline and bridge to remain clearly visible.  The overall lighting should be consistent, matching the sunset lighting across the entire scene. The texture of the sand should be rough and slightly grainy, contrasting with the smoothness of the panda's fur.
