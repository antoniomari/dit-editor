Generate an image depicting a grassy park scene with a line of trees and a paved pathway in the midground. In the background, place a slightly hazy, daytime sky.  The key element is the foreground:  a meticulously detailed digital rendering of the Houses of Parliament in London, England.  This model should be placed directly *behind* the midground trees and pathway,  appearing as though it’s been digitally pasted into the scene and is significantly larger than the surrounding trees.  The Houses of Parliament should occupy a significant portion of the horizontal view, extending almost the full width of the image. The overall lighting of the Houses of Parliament should match the background lighting, so it doesn't appear jarringly out of place.

In the foreground, to the right, and in the bottom third of the image, place a person – a man with short dark hair, sitting cross-legged on a tree stump. He should be wearing a maroon or dark red short-sleeved t-shirt and dark pants. His posture should be relaxed but contemplative, facing towards the Houses of Parliament in the background. His size should be proportional to the scale of the scene, indicating the vast size of the superimposed building.

The overall effect should be surreal and slightly humorous, highlighting the unexpected juxtaposition of a famous London landmark superimposed onto a seemingly ordinary park setting. The style should be photorealistic, aiming for seamless integration of the digitally added element, although the slight blurriness of the Parliament building (to match the background somewhat) will be acceptable, adding to the dreamlike effect.
