Generate an image depicting a tranquil waterfront scene at sunset.  The background should feature a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water, with a cityscape visible beyond.  The city includes several buildings, notably a tall, rectangular high-rise building that stands out against the skyline. The sky should be a blend of soft pastels at the horizon, transitioning to deeper blues and purples overhead, with clouds exhibiting various levels of opacity and a slight suggestion of a sunset.  The water should reflect the sky and the bridge, showcasing a sense of calm and stillness.  The foreground should consist of a sandy beach extending from the water's edge.


The foreground element is a single, realistically rendered red squirrel. The squirrel should be placed on the sandy beach in the lower third of the image, facing left, seemingly foraging or exploring the sand. The squirrel should be well-lit, providing a strong contrast against the darker tones of the sand and the overall cooler tones of the background scene. Its fur should be detailed and show textural variation. The squirrel's placement should not disrupt the overall feel of the background, but rather add a touch of unexpected charm and a scale element to the scene. The final image should appear as though the squirrel is naturally in its environment, with no jarring alterations to the background's overall lighting or color scheme. The focus of the image should be slightly sharper on the squirrel to draw attention to this unexpected element in a calm, peaceful setting.
