Generate an image of a tranquil waterfront scene at sunset.

**Scene:** The main focus is a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water.  The bridge is relatively low to the ground and features a series of evenly spaced supports.  Beyond the bridge, a city skyline is visible, dominated by a tall, rectangular building that appears somewhat dark and imposing against the lighter sky.  There are a few other buildings of varying heights in the skyline to the right of the main building. In the foreground is a sandy beach, textured and slightly out of focus, taking up approximately the lower third of the frame.  The water is relatively calm, with a subtle suggestion of motion, reflecting the sky and the bridge.


**Lighting:** The scene is bathed in the soft, diffused light of either late sunset or early sunrise.  The sky exhibits a beautiful blend of colors, with muted pinks and oranges near the horizon gradually transitioning into cooler blues and grays higher up. The clouds are wispy and spread across the sky, adding depth and drama.  The bridge and city skyline are silhouetted against the lighter sky, enhancing their forms.  The lighting should have a slightly desaturated, almost nostalgic feel.


**Style:** The overall style should evoke a sense of peace and serenity, with a focus on realism but with a touch of artistic flair. Think of a slightly muted, cinematic photograph, possibly with a subtle use of long exposure to blur the water slightly.  The color palette should be natural and subdued, leaning toward cool tones with hints of warm colors in the sky. The focus should be on capturing the atmosphere and mood rather than photorealistic detail.


**Composition:**  The bridge should be positioned slightly off-center, leading the viewer's eye across the water towards the city.  The foreground beach provides a grounding element and directs the viewer's attention toward the horizon. The rule of thirds should be subtly employed, creating a balanced yet visually interesting composition. The overall aspect ratio should be close to a standard landscape orientation.
