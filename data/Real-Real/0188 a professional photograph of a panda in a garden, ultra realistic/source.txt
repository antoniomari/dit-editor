Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene on a slightly overcast day.  The style should be photorealistic, with a slightly muted color palette.

The main focus is a large, well-maintained lawn of a light to medium green hue. This lawn occupies the majority of the foreground and middle ground.  The grass should appear relatively short and even, with a few sparse patches of light brown dirt visible in the very foreground, suggesting a slightly dry or sandy soil.

In the middle ground, a modest, single-story house with a brown roof is partially visible behind a chain-link fence. The house should be a light beige or off-white color.  The fence is simple and functional, not decorative.  A partially visible teal or greenish-blue structure (possibly a shed or outdoor storage unit) is located just in front of the house and slightly to the left.

The background is composed of lush green deciduous trees,  providing a natural backdrop to the house. The trees should be full and leafy, suggesting itâ€™s springtime or early summer.  Power lines are visible running horizontally across the upper mid-ground.

The lighting should be soft and diffused, characteristic of an overcast day. There should be no harsh shadows. The overall mood should be peaceful and tranquil, with a slightly nostalgic feel.

The composition should be a relatively wide shot, with the lawn occupying a significant portion of the frame and the house and trees in the background. The perspective should be from a slightly low angle, as if viewing the scene from slightly below the level of the lawn.
