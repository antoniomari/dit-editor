Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene.  The background should depict a typical suburban house, light-colored, single-story, with a medium-sized lawn. The lawn is a healthy green, slightly patchy in places, indicating natural growth. Mature deciduous trees, showing full summer foliage, surround the house, creating a partially shaded backyard. A chain-link fence is visible along the property line.  The ground is a mix of short-cut grass and some bare patches of light brown earth, particularly noticeable in the foreground near the main subject.


In the foreground, add a giant panda bear. The panda should be positioned centrally in the lower third of the image, appearing to be casually foraging for food in the grass. The panda is mostly white, with distinct black patches around its eyes, ears, and shoulders. It appears to be a relatively young, but fully grown, individual. It is slightly obscured by some patches of grass, suggesting it is partially embedded within the lawn's natural environment.


The panda's placement should not disrupt the overall realism of the suburban backyard setting; it should be integrated as if it naturally belonged there.  The lighting should be consistent, matching the natural lighting of the rest of the scene.  There should be no noticeable seams or other artifacts indicating the panda is a digitally added element.  The overall effect should be slightly surreal, but plausible within the context of the image.
