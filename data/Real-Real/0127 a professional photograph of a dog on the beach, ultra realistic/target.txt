Generate an image of a beach scene at sunset or sunrise. The background should feature a wide, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water.  Behind the bridge, a city skyline is visible, including a tall, rectangular building that stands out among other smaller structures. The sky should be a blend of soft pastel colors at the horizon (pinks, oranges, yellows) gradually transitioning to darker blues and purples higher up.  Clouds should be present, fluffy and spread across the sky. The water should be relatively still, reflecting the city lights and the sunset/sunrise colors.


The foreground consists of a dark grey or black American Pit Bull Terrier puppy lying on a gravelly beach. The puppy is positioned slightly off-center, angled towards the left. It appears relaxed. Partially visible beneath the puppy is another, smaller, dark colored puppy, partially obscured and seemingly resting next to the larger one.  The beach itself is a light grey to brown gravel or sand.

The overall feel should be serene and peaceful, contrasting the urban background with the calm scene of the puppies on the beach.  The lighting should be soft and diffused, reflecting the time of day (sunset/sunrise). The puppies should be in sharp focus, while the background has a slightly softer focus to emphasize the foreground. The puppies should be realistically rendered, showing their texture and fur.
