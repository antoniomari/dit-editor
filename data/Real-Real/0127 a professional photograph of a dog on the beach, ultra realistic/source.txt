Generate an image of a serene waterfront scene at sunset. 


**Scene:** The main focus is a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water. The bridge is relatively low to the horizon, and appears to be a multi-lane highway bridge with several supports along its length. Beyond the bridge, a cityscape is visible, featuring at least one tall, rectangular building that is darker in tone, possibly a hotel or office building, and other buildings of varying heights, all silhouetted against the sky.  The foreground is a beach of coarse, dark sand that stretches from the bottom to about a third of the image height. The water is relatively still, reflecting the sky and the bridge somewhat. There are some small boats or vessels visible near the bridge in the water, but they are not detailed.

**Lighting:** The lighting is a soft, muted sunset. The sky is a mix of blues, purples, and pale oranges and yellows, with clouds of varying density. The clouds are mostly spread across the sky, creating a somewhat dramatic yet calm atmosphere. The direct sunlight is mostly below the horizon, and the scene is illuminated by the diffused light of the sunset, with warmer tones near the horizon and cooler tones higher in the sky. The bridge and buildings are dark silhouettes against the brighter sky.

**Style:** The overall style should be realistic, with a slightly moody and tranquil vibe. The image should have a slightly cinematic quality, with a focus on the composition and the play of light and shadow. The color palette should be fairly muted and subdued, with the emphasis on the tones of the sunset and the contrast between the dark bridge and buildings and the brighter sky.  The water should have a slight motion blur to suggest a gentle flow. The focus should be sharpest on the foreground sand and gradually softens into the background.

**Composition:** The image should be a wide shot, capturing the entire bridge and a portion of the cityscape. The perspective is from a low vantage point on the sandy beach, leading the eye from the foreground sand to the bridge and finally to the cityscape. The rule of thirds could be used to improve the composition, perhaps placing the bridge slightly off-center. The color contrast between the dark sand, the bridge, and the lighter sky creates a dynamic image that guides the viewer's gaze along the horizontal plane.
