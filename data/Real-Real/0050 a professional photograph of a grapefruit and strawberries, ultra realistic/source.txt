Generate a photorealistic image of a slice of tiramisu cake on a white plate surrounded by fresh strawberries.

**Scene:** The main focus is a single, generously sized slice of tiramisu cake. The cake should have visible layers: a light-brown coffee-soaked ladyfinger base, a creamy white mascarpone filling, and possibly another layer of ladyfingers. The top is covered with a glossy, translucent layer, possibly a coffee-flavored glaze, with a small dark coffee bean visible near the top.  The cake should appear moist and rich.  Surrounding the cake are approximately eight to ten fresh strawberries, arranged casually but attractively around the cake, not perfectly symmetrical.  Some strawberries should be closer to the cake than others, creating depth. The strawberries should be ripe, a deep red color, with visible seeds. They should have a natural shine and look juicy. The plate is a simple, clean white, slightly curved rectangular plate.  A small portion of a plain, light beige or off-white background is visible behind the plate.

**Lighting:** The lighting should be soft and diffused, avoiding harsh shadows. The light should highlight the texture of the cake, the glossy glaze, and the juicy appearance of the strawberries.  A subtle highlight should be visible on the top of the cake and the strawberries, suggesting a soft, natural light source from above.

**Style:** The overall style should be clean, simple, and elegant, reminiscent of food photography. The image should be sharp and detailed, showcasing the textures and colors of both the cake and the strawberries. The color palette should be warm and inviting, with the rich browns of the cake contrasting nicely against the deep red of the strawberries and the crisp white of the plate.

**Composition:** The cake should be positioned slightly off-center, creating a more dynamic composition. The strawberries are arranged around the cake in a somewhat loose, natural manner.  The white plate provides a clean background that lets the cake and strawberries stand out.  The overall composition should be visually appealing and balanced, making it look appetizing.  The perspective should be slightly elevated, looking down at the plate at an angle.
