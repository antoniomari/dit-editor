Generate an image of a white plate containing several fresh strawberries arranged somewhat haphazardly.  The strawberries are bright red and glossy, with visible seeds.  The strawberries are clustered mostly towards the edges of the plate and slightly more densely towards the bottom right.

In the foreground, prominently positioned slightly above and to the left of center, is a cross-section of a grapefruit. The grapefruit is a vibrant reddish-pink color, showing juicy segments and some areas of white pith.  Its cut surface is facing the viewer directly.  The grapefruit is large enough to partially overlap the strawberries, appearing as if it has been placed on top of the arrangement of strawberries. The grapefruitâ€™s size and placement create a focal point, contrasting with the smaller, more dispersed strawberries. The overall lighting is soft and natural, highlighting the fresh, vibrant colors of the fruit. The plate is clean and white, providing a stark contrast to the colorful fruit.  The background should be slightly blurred, suggesting a shallow depth of field.  There is no need for additional background elements beyond the suggested blur; the focus should be on the plate and its contents.
