Generate a photorealistic image of a well-worn, light brown teddy bear sitting on a rocky outcrop. 


The bear is positioned slightly off-center, facing to the right, gazing out at a vast landscape. Its fur appears slightly matted and its expression is placid. It has a small, dark blue detail around its neck, possibly a tag.

The rocky outcrop is composed of light grey and brown stones of various sizes, showing signs of weathering and age.  Some rocks are flat and spread out, others are larger and more angular, suggesting a possibly ancient or archaeological site.  There are fragments of what look like broken pottery or stone artifacts scattered around the bear.  The ground is dusty and dry.

The background is a stunning, bright, sunny day.  The sky is a clear, vivid blue, virtually cloudless. The landscape is a series of gently rolling hills, extending to the horizon.  The hills are a mix of light brown and green vegetation, suggesting a dry, possibly Mediterranean climate.  In the midground, there are some low-lying cliffs or rock formations visible, adding depth to the scene.

The lighting is strong, natural sunlight, with clear shadows cast by the rocks and the bear.  The overall style should evoke a sense of peaceful solitude, hinting at the vastness of nature and the passage of time.  The composition should be balanced, drawing the viewer's eye from the bear to the expansive landscape. The overall color palette should be warm, with earthy tones dominating, complemented by the clear blue of the sky.  The image should feel authentic, capturing a moment in time.
