Generate an image of a rocky, mountainous landscape under a clear blue sky.  The background should feature a sun-drenched vista of rolling hills and distant mountains, with a pale green and brown color palette indicating sparse vegetation. The terrain in the immediate foreground is composed of rough, grey and brown rocks of varying sizes, suggesting a possibly ancient ruin or natural rock formation.


In the foreground, place two teddy bears.  One teddy bear is light peach or beige in color, positioned slightly to the left and angled towards the viewer. This bear is larger and shows more detail, with visible stitching, and has small red accents on its feet. This bear appears softer and fluffier. The other teddy bear is a darker brown, smaller, and sits to the right, slightly angled away from the viewer. This bear appears more worn and slightly less detailed.

The bears should appear naturally placed amongst the rocks, as if they've been casually left there.  There should be a sense of scale, showing the bears as relatively small compared to the expansive background. The overall lighting should be consistent with the sunny, outdoor setting. The image should have a slightly whimsical, almost surreal feel, due to the juxtaposition of the cute stuffed animals against the rugged, ancient-looking landscape. There should be no other visible human elements or artifacts besides the two teddy bears.
