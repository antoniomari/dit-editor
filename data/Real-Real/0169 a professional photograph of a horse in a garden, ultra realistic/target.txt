Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene.  The background should consist of a well-maintained lawn, a single-story house with a brown roof and light-colored siding, several mature deciduous trees, and a chain-link fence partially visible along the back of the property. The house should appear to be set back from the street, with lush green grass between it and the fence. There are a few other elements in the background, such as more greenery and possibly some yard decorations or play equipment, but they are less prominent.

In the foreground, centered in the grassy yard, place a dark brown horse with a lighter, almost blonde, tail and mane. The horse should appear calm and somewhat facing away from the viewer, at a slight angle. Its coat should have a slightly glossy sheen, and its features should be clearly defined. The horse is positioned roughly in the lower middle third of the image, occupying a noticeable portion of the foreground but not overwhelming the rest of the scene. The overall lighting should suggest daytime, with soft, natural light, casting slight shadows under the horse but not harshly so.  There is a slight difference in the texture and color of the ground directly around the horse, implying it may be slightly drier or more compacted than the surrounding grass. The overall effect should be a serene and peaceful juxtaposition of domestic life and the presence of the horse.
