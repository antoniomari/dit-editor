Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene on a slightly overcast day.  The style should be photorealistic, with a slightly muted color palette.

The main focus is a large, well-maintained lawn occupying most of the foreground. The lawn is a vibrant yet slightly desaturated green, appearing soft and slightly textured.  A thin strip of light brown, sandy soil is visible in the immediate foreground, suggesting a pathway or bare patch.

In the midground, a modest, single-story house is visible. It's a light brown or beige with a simple, gabled roof.  The house should appear well-maintained but not luxurious. A few shrubs and small trees are visible around the house.  Behind the house, more trees, mostly deciduous and leafy, create a backdrop. The leaves should be a mixture of light and dark greens, suggesting a springtime or early summer setting.

To the left side of the house,  a partially visible section of a chain link fence and a smaller structure (potentially a shed or storage unit) are present, with green netting or fabric partially obscuring the structure.

The lighting should be soft and diffused, indicative of an overcast sky.  There shouldn't be harsh shadows. The overall light should be even, casting few dramatic highlights or deep shadows.

The composition should be from a slightly low angle, looking toward the house and lawn. The overall feel should be peaceful and somewhat unassuming, representative of a typical suburban backyard. The trees should be slightly out-of-focus to emphasize the lawn and house.  A powerline runs horizontally across the middle-ground near the top of the scene.
