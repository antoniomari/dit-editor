Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene.  The background should depict a typical American suburban backyard: a well-maintained lawn, several mature deciduous trees, a single-story house with light-colored siding, and a chain-link fence partially visible along the property line. The house should have a simple, traditional design, possibly with a gable roof. There's also some shrubbery visible near the house and fence. The overall lighting should suggest a sunny day.

In the foreground, place a German Shepherd dog, appearing to run across the lawn. The dog should be positioned slightly off-center, facing towards the lower-right corner of the frame. The dog is predominantly black and tan in color, with a medium-length coat. It looks energetic and alert.  The dog's positioning and apparent motion should create a sense of dynamism in contrast to the otherwise static nature of the background.  The grass where the dog is placed should be slightly less lush, indicating it might be a more compacted or worn area compared to the rest of the lawn.  The image should not appear heavily edited or have obvious seams between the dog and the background.  The composite should look natural and believable.
