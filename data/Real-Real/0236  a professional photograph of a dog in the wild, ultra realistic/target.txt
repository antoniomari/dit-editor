Generate an image of a grassy, hilly landscape with a dirt path winding through it.  The background should depict a rolling hillside covered in lush green vegetation, including various shades of green trees and bushes.  The trees are denser towards the top of the hill and gradually become sparser lower down, transitioning into taller grasses and wildflowers.  The overall lighting should suggest a sunny day.  The sky is not visible, but the light implies a bright, clear day.

In the foreground, slightly off-center, place a fluffy white Maltese dog.  The dog should be positioned near the path, facing slightly to the right. Its fur should be detailed and appear soft and slightly windblown. The dog should appear slightly smaller than an average sized dog,  It's a medium close-up, so details like its eyes, nose and mouth are visible and clear.

The dog should be integrated naturally into the scene, as if it is simply resting in the grass near the path. The grasses around the dog should be slightly parted, suggesting it has recently been there. No shadow is needed as the sun is assumed to be overhead.  The overall mood should be serene and peaceful, with the dog adding a touch of whimsy to the idyllic landscape.
