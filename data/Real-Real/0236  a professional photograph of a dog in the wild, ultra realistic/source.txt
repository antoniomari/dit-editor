Generate a landscape image in a photorealistic style.  The scene is a gently sloping hillside with a grassy path winding through it.  The path is light tan-colored dirt, edged with short, bright green grass, becoming slightly more overgrown with taller, lighter green grasses towards the edges.

The hillside itself is covered in a mix of grasses and wildflowers.  The grasses are predominantly light to medium green, with variations in height and texture suggesting a natural, unkempt feel. Wildflowers are sparsely scattered throughout, mostly small and yellow, providing pops of color against the greens.

In the mid-ground, a grove of small, leafy trees – predominantly a reddish-brown hue suggesting late spring or early summer – stands slightly elevated, partially obscuring the path's progression.  These trees should be slightly softer in focus compared to the foreground grasses and the path.

Beyond the trees and slightly out of focus, the hillside continues, culminating in a backdrop of a dense forest of dark green evergreen trees that stretch across the top third of the image. This forest should have a slight haze or atmospheric perspective, suggesting depth and distance.

The lighting should be soft, diffused sunlight, typical of an overcast day or early morning/late afternoon. Avoid harsh shadows; the overall scene should be bathed in a warm, even light. The colors should be naturalistic and slightly muted, avoiding overly saturated hues. The overall composition is a wide, panoramic shot with the path leading the eye from the foreground towards the background forest. The aspect ratio should be slightly wider than it is tall.  There should be a subtle feeling of calmness and tranquility.
