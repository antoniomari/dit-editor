Generate an image depicting a serene waterfront scene at sunset. 


The background should feature a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water. The bridge should be dark gray or black, and its architecture should be clearly defined. Behind the bridge, a city skyline is visible, featuring several buildings, including a prominent, tall rectangular building, that are silhouetted against a colorful sunset sky.  The sky should be a mixture of vibrant oranges, pinks, and purples at the horizon, gradually transitioning to darker blues and grays higher up. Clouds should be present, adding depth and texture to the sky. The water should be relatively calm, reflecting the colors of the sky and the silhouette of the city.


In the foreground, there's a single, vibrant yellow flower lying on a dark gray sandy beach. The flower should be in sharp focus, contrasting with the slightly blurred background. The flower should be positioned slightly off-center, toward the bottom third of the image, and near enough to the water's edge to show the wet sand. The overall composition should emphasize the contrast between the man-made structures and the natural elements, with the flower acting as a focal point suggesting peace and tranquility amidst the urban landscape. The beach should be subtly textured and show evidence of dampness from the nearby water.  The lighting should mimic that of a sunset, with a soft glow illuminating the scene. The overall mood should be peaceful and slightly melancholic.
