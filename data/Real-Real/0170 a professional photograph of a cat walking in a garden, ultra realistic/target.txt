Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene. The background should feature a single-story house with a light brown or beige exterior.  The house is partially obscured by lush green trees and a chain-link fence. The yard is primarily a well-maintained lawn of a vibrant green color, with patches of bare, light brown dirt visible, especially in the foreground. The lawn slopes gently downward from the house towards the viewer.  A chain link fence runs along the edge of the property visible in the left and partially right of the image.

In the foreground, place a Pembroke Welsh Corgi facing away from the viewer, towards the house. The dog should be positioned in the lower third of the image, approximately centered horizontally. The Corgi is tri-colored (brown, black and white), with a noticeable fluffy tail. The dog appears to be standing on relatively bare earth, with sparse grass.  The Corgi should appear alert but relaxed, as if watching something near the house.


The overall lighting of the scene should be soft and natural, suggesting daytime.  The color palette is predominantly greens and browns, with the earthy tones of the ground contrasting against the vibrant green of the grass. The addition of the Corgi should feel natural, as though the dog naturally belongs in this scene.  No major adjustments to the lighting or atmosphere of the background image should be made to accommodate the dog. The focus should remain on the natural scene, with the dog as a natural addition.
