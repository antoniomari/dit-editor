Generate an image of a sesame seed hamburger bun, containing a beef patty, lettuce, tomato, and cheese.  The burger should appear freshly made and juicy.  The burger should be placed centrally on a white rectangular plate.

Surrounding the burger on the plate are several fresh, ripe strawberries.  The strawberries should be arranged somewhat haphazardly but attractively, with some slightly overlapping others.  They should be positioned both near the burger and at the edges of the plate, creating a visually appealing contrast in color and texture between the burger and the fruit.  A few strawberries should be partially hidden under the burger's bottom bun.

The overall lighting should be bright and even, emphasizing the textures of both the burger and strawberries. The background should be a plain, unfocused, light-colored surface, drawing attention to the food on the plate.  The overall impression should be one of appetizing freshness.
