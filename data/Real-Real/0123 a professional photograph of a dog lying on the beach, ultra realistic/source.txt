Generate an image of a tranquil waterfront scene at sunset.

**Scene:** The focal point is a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water.  The bridge is a muted grey or dark charcoal color, with subtle architectural details visible but not overly emphasized.  Behind the bridge, a cityscape is visible, featuring a prominent, tall rectangular building that's slightly darker than its surroundingsâ€”possibly a hotel or office building. Other, smaller buildings are visible, but less distinct. The cityscape is fairly low-rise.


**Lighting:** The lighting should be reminiscent of a sunset, with warm, muted oranges and yellows near the horizon, gradually transitioning to cooler blues and purples higher in the sky. The clouds should be dramatic but not overly stormy, possibly with some breaks in the clouds allowing soft light to peek through. The overall lighting should be soft and diffused, not harsh or bright. The reflection of the sky and bridge should be visible in the water, but it should be a soft, not overly sharp reflection.  The bridge itself should be somewhat silhouetted against the brighter sky.

**Style:** The style should be realistic, with a slightly painterly or impressionistic quality.  The image should have a serene and peaceful mood. The color palette should be muted and natural, avoiding overly saturated or vibrant colors. The focus should be on capturing the atmosphere and mood rather than hyperrealism. The image should have a slightly wide angle feel with foreground, middle ground and background clearly visible.


**Composition:** The image should be composed with a foreground of a sandy beach, leading the viewer's eye towards the bridge and cityscape in the background. The horizon line should be roughly in the middle of the frame.  The sandy beach in the foreground should be slightly out of focus, gently drawing attention to the bridge and sky. There should be a sense of depth and perspective created by the receding shoreline to the bridge and city beyond.   The slightly soft focus on the foreground and relatively sharp focus on the bridge will aid in creating a pleasing composition.
