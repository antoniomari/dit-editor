Generate an image of a white ceramic espresso cup, labeled "Cubano" in a stylized blue font, sitting on a white plate.  The cup is about two-thirds full of espresso, with a light crema visible on the surface.  The cup is positioned slightly off-center, leaning slightly towards the lower-right of the frame.

Surrounding the base of the cup on the plate are several fresh strawberries, arranged somewhat haphazardly, but mostly clustered near the cup. The strawberries are bright red, and display a natural variation in shape and size.  Some strawberries are whole, others appear to be partially cut.  A portion of a slice of cake is partially visible in the upper-right quadrant of the frame, partially obscured by the cup's handle.  The cake appears light-colored and layered. The background is blurry and out of focus, suggesting a soft, neutral light ambiance. The plate is clean and white, providing a stark contrast to the red strawberries and the rich brown espresso.  The overall scene is one of simple, elegant breakfast setting.
