Generate an image of a light teal-colored cake, frosted with a decorative design, centrally placed on a white plate. The cake is round and has a slightly domed top.  The frosting design features symmetrical swirling patterns, almost like stylized leaves or floral motifs, in a lighter shade of teal against the slightly darker teal base frosting. The cake's texture should appear smooth and slightly glossy.


The plate also contains several golden-brown, crispy-looking spring rolls or egg rolls scattered around the cake. These are arranged somewhat haphazardly, not in a neat pattern.  Some are partially overlapping, and they show variations in size and shape, suggesting that they are individually fried rather than mass-produced.  They should have a slightly oily sheen and some visible texture from the frying process. The spring rolls should appear freshly fried, with warm-toned highlights and shadows to enhance their texture.


The overall lighting is soft and even, illuminating both the cake and the spring rolls without harsh shadows. The background is out of focus, but a suggestion of a pale wood table and some green garnish (possibly lettuce and carrots, but not explicitly detailed) can be faintly visible.  The cake dominates the foreground and draws the eye, but the spring rolls are clearly visible, providing a contrast in color, texture, and subject matter. The overall feel of the image should be one of casual, slightly unusual juxtaposition: a formal-looking cake presented alongside a simple snack.
