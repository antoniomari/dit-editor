Generate an image of a close-up shot of several golden-brown spring rolls arranged artfully on a clean, bright white plate.  The spring rolls should have a slightly crispy texture visible in the image.  They are accompanied by a small, white ramekin filled with a dark reddish-brown dipping sauce, and a garnish of finely shredded carrots and fresh green lettuce leaves.

**Scene:** The scene is simple, focusing on the food. The plate is the dominant element, with the food arranged slightly off-center for visual interest.  The background is softly blurred, suggesting a light-colored wooden table.

**Lighting:** The lighting should be soft and diffused, avoiding harsh shadows. It should highlight the golden-brown color of the spring rolls and the glossy sheen of the sauce without creating over-exposure.  The overall lighting should have a warm, inviting feel, typical of a restaurant setting.

**Style:** The style should be photorealistic with a shallow depth of field, focusing attention on the spring rolls and their immediate surroundings. The overall aesthetic should be clean, appetizing, and slightly elevated, suggestive of a casual but tasteful dining experience. The image should be sharp and detailed, with a focus on texture.

**Composition:** The composition should be balanced, with the spring rolls forming a visually appealing cluster.  The ramekin of sauce and the garnish should complement the arrangement of the spring rolls, creating a cohesive and visually pleasing whole. The white plate provides a clean contrast to the golden-brown spring rolls, making them stand out prominently. The perspective should be slightly elevated, looking down at the plate, as if captured from a diner's perspective.
