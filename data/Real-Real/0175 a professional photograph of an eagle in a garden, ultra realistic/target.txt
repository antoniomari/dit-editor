Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene on a partly cloudy day.  The background should be a well-maintained lawn, with a single-story house visible in the mid-ground. The house is light-colored, possibly beige or light brown, with a fairly standard suburban design.  Mature trees surround the house and lawn, with some leaves visible. A chain-link fence is partially visible to the left, running along part of the property line. The grass should be a vibrant green, showing good health. The ground in the foreground is a mix of patchy grass and light brown, sandy soil.

The foreground element is a large bald eagle, in flight, positioned in the mid-ground of the image, slightly to the right of center.  The eagle should be sharp and detailed, with its wings spread in a dynamic pose that suggests it's just passing over the backyard.  Its position should be such that it appears to be flying over the lawn, heading towards the slightly-right-of-center area, at about eye-level relative to a viewer in the foreground. The eagle is prominently featured, yet not so large it overshadows the house or lawn. The lighting on the eagle should be consistent with the natural lighting of the rest of the scene.

The overall effect should be a peaceful, slightly surreal sceneâ€”a normal suburban backyard unexpectedly visited by a magnificent eagle. The eagle's presence should add a sense of grandeur and a touch of the unexpected to the otherwise mundane setting.  The eagle should not cast a shadow, ensuring it is seamlessly integrated into the existing lighting. The image should have a natural and somewhat realistic quality.
