Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene on a slightly overcast day.  The style should be photorealistic, with a slightly muted color palette.

The main focus is a large, relatively flat lawn of vibrant, but not overly saturated, green grass. This lawn occupies the majority of the foreground and middle ground of the image.  The grass shows some subtle variations in texture, possibly slightly patchy in areas, indicating a natural, not perfectly manicured look. A strip of light-brown, sandy or dry soil is visible in the very foreground, running horizontally across the bottom of the image.

In the mid-ground, a single-story, light-brown or beige house is visible. It's a simple structure, rectangular in shape, with visible windows and a gently sloping roof.  The house appears somewhat plain and lacks prominent architectural details.  The house isn't the main focus, but serves as a background element.

The background is dominated by a line of mature deciduous trees, mostly green and full of leaves, suggesting a springtime or early summer setting.  The trees vary in size and type, but have an overall natural and somewhat unkempt look.  Some lighter areas between the trees suggest open sky, but the overall lighting is soft and diffused, indicating an overcast sky; there are no harsh shadows.  A wire runs horizontally across the scene, just behind the line of trees, slightly above the house.  A chain-link fence runs along the edge of the lawn closest to the viewer, separating the lawn from the slightly visible front yard of the house.

The overall composition should be a wide shot, capturing a large portion of the lawn and the house in the background. The perspective should be from a slightly low angle, as if the viewer is standing near the fence line looking towards the house. The overall feeling should be peaceful, quiet, and slightly understated, reflecting a typical suburban backyard scene. There should be a few small, indistinct details in the background, like some greenery near the house, to add realism, but nothing should distract from the primary focus on the lawn and house.
