Generate an image of a roasted chicken placed centrally on a white plate, appearing as if it is slightly hovering above the plate.  The chicken should be golden-brown and glistening, with visible stuffing peeking out from the cavity. It should have a crispy skin texture and slightly browned edges. The chickenâ€™s legs are positioned such that one leg is slightly visible to the left and the other one extends to the right, but underneath.  The chicken should have the overall appearance of having been recently cooked.  

Surrounding the chicken are several fresh, ripe strawberries arranged loosely around it on the plate, creating a visually appealing contrast in color and texture.  The strawberries should be glossy and red, with visible seeds.  Some strawberries are positioned closer to the chicken and partially underneath it, while others are arranged around the perimeter of the plate.   The strawberries should appear as if they are resting on the plate's surface.

The plate itself is a simple, clean, white rectangular plate, reflecting slightly, indicating a smooth surface.  The lighting should be soft and even, illuminating both the chicken and strawberries evenly.  The background should be subtly blurred, implying a shallow depth of field, thus drawing focus to the chicken and strawberries in the foreground. The overall image should look appetizing and slightly surreal due to the unusual juxtaposition of the chicken and the strawberries.
