Generate an image depicting the Manhattan Bridge in New York City.  The bridge should be positioned as if viewed from a slightly lower vantage point, showing a portion of the bridge's undercarriage and a good view of the suspension cables and towers. The overall lighting should suggest a sunny day, with relatively clear skies and little to no visible cloud cover.  The color palette should be somewhat muted, reflecting the natural tones of the steel bridge against a relatively pale sky.

The background behind the bridge should be a cityscape consistent with the New York City skyline, including various buildings of different heights and styles. A portion of the East River should be visible as well.

Superimposed on this background, directly under the center of the bridge and behind the bridge's support structures, should be a photorealistic image of the Houses of Parliament in London, England. The Houses of Parliament should be sized so that it sits comfortably within the visual space created by the bridge's frame, replacing the actual background buildings in that specific area.  The lighting of the Houses of Parliament should be consistent with that of the New York skyline, maintaining a consistent sense of time of day and lighting conditions across the entire image.

The overall effect should be a surreal juxtaposition of two iconic locations from different continents, with the Manhattan Bridge framing the Houses of Parliament as if it were a part of the New York City skyline.  The visual impact should be striking yet seamless, with the superimposed image blending realistically into the background, making it look as if the Houses of Parliament had been magically transported to the East River in New York City.  The color and contrast of the Houses of Parliament should match the overall muted tones of the existing scene.  There should be a slight haze or atmospheric perspective consistent with the distance between the viewer and the distant buildings and the Parliament.
