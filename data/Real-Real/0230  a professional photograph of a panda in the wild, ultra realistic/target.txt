Generate an image of a lush, hilly landscape reminiscent of a panda reserve.  The background should be a gently sloping hillside covered in a variety of green vegetation, including dark green coniferous trees forming a backdrop on the upper third, and interspersed with lighter green shrubs and bushes closer to the foreground.  Wildflowers, primarily yellow, are scattered sparsely in the lower grassy areas. A faint, light brown dirt path meanders from the middle ground towards the bottom right corner.  The lighting should suggest a sunny day, with soft shadows.

In the foreground, slightly off-center towards the bottom, place a young, relatively small giant panda. The panda is positioned as if it is partially hidden amongst the taller grasses and wildflowers, mostly facing the viewer but angled slightly to its right, looking down as if eating or sniffing the ground.  The panda's fur should be rendered realistically, with distinct black and white markings. The panda is slightly obscured by vegetation in the foreground, giving a sense of depth.  It should be integrated seamlessly into the background so the lighting and shadowing on the panda match the overall scene's ambiance.  The overall effect should be a peaceful and natural-looking scene where the panda feels organically integrated into its environment, rather than appearing superimposed.
