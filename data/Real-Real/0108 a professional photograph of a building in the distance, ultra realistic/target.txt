Generate an image of a sunny rural landscape featuring a two-lane asphalt road stretching towards rolling green hills under a partly cloudy sky. 


On the left side of the road, there's a field of tall, dry corn stalks bordering a grassy verge.  The grass extends along the road's edge. In the far distance, low, rounded hills are visible under a blue sky with fluffy white clouds.


The foreground element is a light beige, plush teddy bear, positioned slightly off-center to the left, at approximately the one-third mark of the image, and partially obscuring the cornfield. Its face is turned toward the viewer, with its body angled slightly to the left, suggesting it’s looking down the road.


In the background, almost directly in line with the road and slightly off-center to the right, is a seemingly out-of-place, large, modern, white building. It's a tall, somewhat oddly shaped building with a unique design—it resembles a modern skyscraper but appears slightly truncated or unfinished at the top. The style is contemporary and possibly futuristic; it is clearly a non-typical building for such a rural setting and creates a sense of incongruity.


The lighting should be bright and natural, characteristic of a sunny day.  The overall color palette should be warm, with greens, browns, and blues dominating. The image should have a slightly surreal feel due to the juxtaposition of the teddy bear and the unusual building in this idyllic countryside setting. The image should feel crisp and have a photorealistic quality. The road should have a vanishing point that leads directly to the background hills.  Ensure that the teddy bear is not overly sharp or out of scale with the environment—a sense of realism in its placement is crucial.
