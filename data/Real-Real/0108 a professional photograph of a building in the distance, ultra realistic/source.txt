Generate an image of a fluffy, cream-colored teddy bear positioned in the foreground, slightly off-center to the left.  The bear should be looking towards the viewer, its face occupying a significant portion of the frame. Its fur should be realistically textured, appearing soft and plush, with a brown nose and subtly stitched mouth.

The background features a long, straight asphalt road stretching into the distance, vanishing point roughly at the center-horizon.  The road is bordered by grassy verges, the grass varying in shades of green, slightly taller and fuller near the bear and gradually shortening towards the road.  Beyond the verge, a field of tall, dry, golden-brown corn stalks stretches across the middle ground.


In the far distance, rolling hills are visible under a clear, sunny sky.  The sky should have a few scattered cumulus clouds, mostly white and fluffy, but overall bright and blue. The hills are a muted range of greens and browns, appearing somewhat distant and hazy. There are some industrial structures or farm buildings faintly visible near the road on the horizon.

The overall lighting should be bright and sunny, characteristic of a clear day with the sun high in the sky. The scene should be rendered in a photorealistic style, with a slightly shallow depth of field, making the bear sharply in focus while the background slightly softer, drawing the viewer's eye to the bear first.  The overall composition should convey a sense of calm, open space, and a road trip feel. The color palette should be natural and warm, with a slightly muted and realistic feel.
