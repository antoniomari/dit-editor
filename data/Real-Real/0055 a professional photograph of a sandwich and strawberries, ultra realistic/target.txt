Generate an image of a white plate containing fresh strawberries arranged around a double-decker egg and toast sandwich.  The sandwich is positioned slightly off-center, resting atop a partially visible slice of white cake with a dark berry topping.  The cake is subtly visible beneath the sandwich. The strawberries are bright red and glossy, and their positioning is somewhat casual, not perfectly symmetrical, implying a natural arrangement. The plate is a simple, clean white, with a slight reflective sheen. The lighting is soft and even, avoiding harsh shadows. The focus should be sharpest on the sandwich and strawberries in the foreground, with a slight softening towards the background cake.

The overall feel should be lighthearted and slightly whimsical, as if itâ€™s a playful juxtaposition of foods. The toast is golden brown and slightly crisp-looking, while the eggs are a pale yellow with visible texture.  The entire scene should evoke a feeling of a casual, slightly quirky breakfast or brunch.
