Generate an image of a pale yellow Labrador Retriever puppy sitting on a sandy beach.  The puppy should be positioned slightly off-center, facing the viewer, and be the main focus of the foreground.  It should be wearing a pink collar.  The puppy should appear realistically rendered with attention to detail in its fur texture and expression.  

The background should depict a cityscape at dusk or dawn.  Specifically, render a long bridge spanning a wide body of water, with buildings including a tall, rectangular high-rise building visible on the far side. The sky should be a blend of muted pinks, oranges, and blues typical of sunrise or sunset, with a slightly cloudy atmosphere. The water should be relatively calm, reflecting the sky and the city lights faintly. The sand of the beach in the foreground should be a coarse, dark grayish-brown, contrasting slightly with the puppy's light fur.  The overall lighting of the image should be soft and evocative of the time of day, creating a serene and peaceful atmosphere.  The integration of the puppy into the background should be seamless, appearing as if it naturally belongs in the scene. The composition should create a sense of scale, showing the puppy as relatively small against the vastness of the cityscape and the expanse of water.
