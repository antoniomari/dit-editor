Generate an image of a tranquil waterfront scene at either dawn or dusk. 


**Scene:** The focal point is a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water. The bridge has a relatively simple, flat design, with supports visible beneath the roadway.  Beyond the bridge is a cityscape, featuring a prominent, tall, rectangular building (a hotel perhaps) standing slightly apart from other, shorter buildings.  The overall cityscape is low-rise and relatively quiet, not densely packed with skyscrapers. A sandy beach or shore is in the foreground, running horizontally across the bottom third of the frame, with the focus being closer to the viewer's perspective.

**Lighting:** The light should be soft and diffused, indicative of either the early morning or late evening hours.  The sky should display a gradient of colors; perhaps pastel pinks and oranges near the horizon, subtly transitioning into a cooler, muted blue-grey towards the top of the frame. The clouds should be mostly wispy and spread out, not dense or stormy. The scene should be somewhat dimly lit, with no harsh shadows.  The bridge should be somewhat silhouetted against the sky. The water should be relatively calm, with subtle reflections of the sky and buildings.

**Style:** The overall style should be photorealistic, striving for a sense of calmness and serenity. The image should have a slightly desaturated, almost vintage feel, in terms of colors.  The perspective should be from a slightly low vantage point, closer to the sand, looking across the water toward the bridge and city. The water should appear smooth and slightly blurry, suggesting a long exposure.  The sand in the foreground should be slightly grainy and in focus.

**Composition:** Use the rule of thirds to position the bridge and city off-center, and the beach in the foreground provides a nice leading line into the scene. This will provide a pleasing and balanced composition.  The calm water acts as a natural separator between the foreground and the background elements. The subtle reflections in the water will enhance the overall serenity of the picture.
