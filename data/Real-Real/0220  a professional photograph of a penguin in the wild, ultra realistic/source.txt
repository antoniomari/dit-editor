Generate a pastoral landscape image in a photorealistic style, featuring a gently sloping hillside. 


**Scene:** The scene is a sun-drenched, verdant hillside. A dirt path, light brown in color, meanders from the mid-ground to the foreground, appearing slightly worn but well-trodden. The path cuts through a field of tall, light green grasses and wildflowers.  Patches of taller, brighter green grass suggest slight undulations in the terrain.  Yellow wildflowers are scattered sparsely throughout the foreground, with clusters of them near the path. Some reddish-brown wildflowers stand out near the bottom left. 


The middle ground features a grouping of small, leafy, reddish-brown trees or bushes, with some slightly taller green trees beyond. This grouping is slightly darker than the surrounding grass but still well lit. 


The background consists of a dense, dark green forest of coniferous trees covering the upper portion of the image, creating a strong contrast against the lighter foreground. The trees are varied in height and are not uniform. A slight haze or atmospheric perspective makes the farthest trees less distinct.


**Lighting:** The lighting should suggest a bright, sunny day. The light should be soft and diffused, with no harsh shadows, indicating either morning or late afternoon sunlight. The overall tone should be warm and inviting, with a golden hue to the grasses and a cooler green tone in the trees. There should be a consistent light across the image, with no significant variations in brightness.


**Style:** Photorealistic style. The image should look like a high-resolution photograph. Colors should be natural and vibrant, textures should be detailed, including the subtle textures of the grasses, wildflowers, and tree leaves.  The depth of field should extend a fair way into the background.


**Overall Composition:** The path acts as a leading line, drawing the viewer's eye through the scene from the foreground towards the background forest. The composition should be balanced, with the foreground and background elements in harmony. The slightly off-center path adds visual interest. The color contrast between the dark green forest and the lighter grassy field is important. The image's focal point is the path and the wildflowers around it, though the forest background is crucial to the overall mood.
