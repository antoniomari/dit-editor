Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene on an overcast day.  The style should be photorealistic, with a slightly muted color palette.

The main focus is a large, verdant lawn occupying the majority of the foreground and middle ground. The grass is a bright but slightly desaturated green, showing some subtle textural variations in height and color. The lawn is mostly even, with minor patches of bare earth visible closer to the foreground, implying a slightly sandy or dry soil underneath.


In the mid-ground, there is a well-maintained residential house, a single-story structure with a light brownish-grey roof and light-colored walls. It is partially obscured by mature, leafy deciduous trees.  The house is not the focal point; its details are not critical but should be suggestive of a typical suburban dwelling.  A chain-link fence is partially visible in front of the house and extending to the left.

The background features a cluster of lush green deciduous trees of various sizes, with branches extending across the frame. The trees are thick with leaves, suggesting springtime or early summer. The sky should be an overcast, soft white or light grey, creating even, soft lighting across the scene, without harsh shadows.

The overall composition should be a wide shot, with the viewpoint from a relatively low angle, creating a sense of spaciousness in the yard. There are some small, indistinct details in the background near the house, suggesting other elements of a garden or yard, such as a grill or small shed. but they are secondary to the overall composition and lawn. The lighting should be diffuse, minimizing strong contrasts and providing a calm, tranquil mood.
