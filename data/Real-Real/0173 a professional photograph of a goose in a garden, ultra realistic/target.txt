Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene.  The background should feature a well-maintained lawn, a single-story house with a light-brown roof, visible through mature leafy trees.  A chain-link fence runs along the left edge of the yard, partially obscured by trees and bushes.  The house should appear slightly distant, giving the impression of depth.  The lighting should suggest a somewhat overcast day. The overall color palette is natural and muted greens and browns.


In the foreground, add a single, adult white swan.  The swan should be positioned towards the bottom center of the image, resting on a slightly more sandy or bare patch of lawn, which contrasts lightly with the surrounding greener grass.  The swan's pose should be relaxed, possibly with its head tucked slightly.  The swan's presence should feel naturally integrated into the scene, as if it has simply settled down in the yard. The addition of the swan should add a touch of serenity and unexpectedness to the overall suburban setting.  The swan should not appear digitally altered, but instead seamlessly integrated into the background.
