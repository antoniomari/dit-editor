Generate an image of a grassy hillside scene with a dirt path winding through it.  The hillside is covered in low-lying vegetation and dotted with small, leafy trees and shrubs, predominantly shades of green, with a few touches of yellow wildflowers.  The background should feature a line of taller evergreen trees atop the hill, creating a sense of depth. The sky should be subtly visible but not a strong feature. The lighting should be soft and diffused, indicative of a sunny day but without harsh shadows.


In the foreground, slightly to the left of center, position a single rhea. The rhea should be realistically rendered, with dark, fluffy plumage and a long neck.  It should be standing on the grassy area adjacent to the dirt path, facing towards the right of the frame. The rhea should appear to be walking along the edge of the path but not actually on it.


The overall effect should be a serene and slightly whimsical scene, with the rhea seeming naturally integrated into the landscape, as if it belongs there. The rhea shouldnâ€™t be overly large or out of scale with the surrounding vegetation.  The composition should emphasize the natural beauty of the background while showcasing the rhea as a focal point, but not the *only* focal point.  Maintain a balance between both elements.
