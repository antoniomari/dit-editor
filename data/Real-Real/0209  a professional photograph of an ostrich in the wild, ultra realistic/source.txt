Generate a background image depicting a gently sloping hillside scene bathed in soft, diffused sunlight.  The overall style should be photorealistic, with a slightly hazy or dreamy quality to the atmosphere.  The color palette should be primarily composed of muted greens, yellows, and browns, suggestive of a summer day.

**Scene:**

The foreground consists of a grassy path winding upwards through a meadow. The meadow is dotted with wildflowers, primarily yellow and orange hues in small clusters, with taller, green wild grasses and weeds interspersed. The path itself is a light brownish-tan, appearing lightly trodden, not perfectly manicured.

Midground: The path leads up to a slightly higher elevation where a small copse of reddish-brown leafy trees stands, forming a natural break in the landscape. These trees are subtly detailed, not hyperrealistic.  Beyond the trees, the meadow continues, stretching upwards.

Background:  Rolling hills covered with lush green coniferous and deciduous forests.  The trees are mostly dark green, indicating a dense canopy, but their details should be soft and slightly indistinct, keeping the focus on the midground and foreground. The trees appear at different heights creating a natural, uneven texture.  The distance should be slightly blurred to convey depth.

**Lighting:**

The lighting should be soft, diffused sunlight, without harsh shadows.  The scene should be well-lit but not overly bright, avoiding any areas of extreme contrast. A slight haze should be present, softening edges and colors. The light should gently highlight the wildflowers in the foreground and the reddish-brown tones of the small copse of trees.

**Composition:**

The composition should utilize the rule of thirds, with the path and the copse of trees forming a natural leading line towards the higher elevation of the background. The viewer's eye should be drawn along the path towards the background hills.

**Overall:**

The image should convey a feeling of peace and tranquility, capturing the subtle beauty of a natural landscape on a calm, sunny day.  The texture of the grasses and the slight blur of the background should create a sense of depth and spaciousness, giving it a calm and serene feel.  The slightly hazy effect should further enhance this dreamy quality.
