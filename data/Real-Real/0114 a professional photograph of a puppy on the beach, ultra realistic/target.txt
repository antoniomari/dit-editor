Generate an image of a beach scene at sunset, featuring a long bridge and a cityscape in the background.  The sky should be a dramatic mix of sunset hues (oranges, pinks, and purples) blending into cooler blues and grays towards the zenith.  The clouds should be fairly substantial, adding to the dramatic effect.  The bridge should be a long, modern structure, dark gray or black in color, spanning the width of the image across the mid-ground.  Beyond the bridge, a cityscape should be visible, primarily silhouetted against the sky; it should feature several tall buildings, at least one being a high-rise structure, suggestive of a downtown area.  The water in the foreground should be relatively calm, reflecting the colors of the sky and the buildings.

In the foreground, positioned slightly off-center, add a fluffy golden retriever puppy. The puppy should be sitting on a dark-grey, coarse-grained sandy beach. Its fur should be light cream/beige, and it should appear playful and friendly. The puppy should be in sharp focus, contrasting with a slightly softer focus on the background to emphasize it as the main subject. The puppy should be slightly to the left of the center. The overall lighting should be soft and somewhat muted, appropriate for a sunset scene.

The image should feel peaceful and serene, despite the urban backdrop. The contrast between the cute puppy and the city's industrial feel should be subtly emphasized.  Ensure the puppy is well-lit and clearly visible against the darker beach and background.  The perspective should be from a relatively low angle, as if looking down at the puppy from a slightly raised vantage point.
