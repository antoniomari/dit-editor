Generate an image of a close-up shot of a plate of crispy fried spring rolls, arranged somewhat haphazardly,  with a small white ramekin of dark brown dipping sauce in the upper-middle. A small garnish of shredded carrots and lettuce is to the left and slightly behind the spring rolls.


**Scene:** A simple, clean white plate holds the food. The background is subtly out of focus, suggesting a light-colored wooden table. The overall setting is casual and inviting, possibly a restaurant or home setting.

**Lighting:** Soft, diffused natural light illuminates the scene, highlighting the golden-brown color of the spring rolls and the glossy sheen of the sauce. The lighting should be even, avoiding harsh shadows.

**Style:** The style should be photorealistic, with a focus on sharp details, particularly on the texture of the spring rolls (crispy, slightly uneven surface) and the sheen of the sauce. The overall feel should be appetizing and inviting.  The color palette is warm and natural, with the golden browns of the spring rolls being dominant, contrasting with the vibrant green of the lettuce and the rich brown of the sauce.

**Composition:** The spring rolls are the main focus, slightly clustered in the lower center and right of the plate. The sauce and garnish provide supporting elements, arranged off-center to create a visually balanced yet informal composition. The perspective is from slightly above, looking down onto the plate. The image should be sharp and clear, with a shallow depth of field, gently blurring the background to keep the focus on the food.
