Generate an image of a white plate containing a selection of crispy fried spring rolls arranged somewhat haphazardly, alongside a small white ramekin of dark brown dipping sauce.  A vibrant garnish of shredded green lettuce and thin orange carrot sticks is positioned at the upper left corner of the plate.

The foreground element is a chocolate donut, glazed with a dark chocolate icing and topped with six smaller, lighter beige-colored pastry cream swirls arranged around the donut hole.  The donut sits in the lower-center of the plate, partially overlapping some of the spring rolls and in front of the pile of spring rolls.  The donut's chocolate glaze is glossy and reflective. The cream swirls are distinct and appear soft and slightly raised.

The background, the spring rolls and sauce, should be slightly blurred to emphasize the sharp focus on the donut in the foreground.  The overall lighting should be soft and warm, mimicking natural light. The color palette is warm and appetizing, with the browns of the spring rolls and the dark chocolate of the donut contrasting nicely with the orange of the carrots and the green of the lettuce. The image should have a shallow depth of field, focusing on the donut, making the spring rolls slightly out of focus. The overall effect should be of a delicious and tempting food image.
