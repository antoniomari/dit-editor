Generate an image of a single slice of tiramisu cake on a white plate surrounded by fresh strawberries.

**Scene:** The main focus is a triangular slice of tiramisu cake, meticulously layered with light-brown coffee-soaked sponge and a thick layer of creamy mascarpone. The top is glazed with a clear, glossy layer that subtly reveals the layers beneath; a single dark coffee bean is visible on the glaze. The cake sits slightly off-center on a clean, bright white rectangular plate.  Around the cake are several fresh, ripe strawberries, arranged somewhat casually but attractively.  Some strawberries are whole, others slightly cut.  Their deep red color contrasts sharply with the white of the plate and the light color of the cake.

**Lighting:** The lighting is soft and diffused, avoiding harsh shadows. It enhances the textures of the cake and the glossy glaze, and brings out the juicy redness of the strawberries. The overall tone is warm and inviting, suggestive of a home setting or a cozy caf√©.

**Style:** The style is photorealistic, with a focus on accurate representation of textures and colors. The image should have a slightly elevated perspective, not directly overhead, but angled to show both the cake and strawberries clearly. The image should be crisp and detailed, showcasing the fine textures of the cake layers and the delicate details of the strawberries.  The overall aesthetic is clean and appetizing.

**Composition:** The cake is the central element, with the strawberries arranged artfully around it to create a pleasing visual balance. The white plate provides a clean background that doesn't distract from the food. The composition is simple but elegant, focusing on the beauty of the dessert and the freshness of the fruit. The overall aspect ratio should be approximately landscape oriented.  Avoid any distracting elements in the background.
