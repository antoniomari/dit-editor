Generate an image of a white plate containing several fresh strawberries arranged around a piece of cheesecake and a heart-shaped waffle.

The background is a simple white plate, slightly angled, with soft lighting.  Several fresh, ripe strawberries, varying slightly in size, are arranged in a loose circle around the main elements.  They are a deep red, with visible seeds and a slightly glossy sheen.

The foreground elements are a slice of cheesecake and a large, heart-shaped waffle. The cheesecake is light-colored, possibly vanilla or similar, with a visible swirl or marbling, and a dark speck (possibly coffee or chocolate) on top. It's positioned slightly behind and to the left of the center. The heart-shaped waffle is golden-brown and sits prominently in the foreground, partially overlapping the cheesecake and extending towards the right side of the plate.  The waffle has a clearly defined grid pattern and appears crisp and slightly sweet, possibly with a dusting of powdered sugar. The waffle is positioned so that its point faces right, creating a slightly dynamic feel to the composition.


The overall scene depicts a sweet, dessert-focused composition. The heart-shaped waffle acts as the main focal point of the image, contrasted by the slightly less saturated colors of the cheesecake and strawberries. The arrangement is appealing and suggests a simple, yet appetizing dessert presentation. The interaction between the elements is one of overlapping and adjacencyâ€”the waffle visually dominates, but the cheesecake and strawberries provide context and balance.
