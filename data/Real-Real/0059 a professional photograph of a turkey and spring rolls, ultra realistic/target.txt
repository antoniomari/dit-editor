Generate an image of a white plate containing a meal.  The plate is mostly filled with a roasted chicken, positioned slightly below center and overlapping the other elements. The chicken is dark reddish-brown, appearing roasted and crispy with some glistening highlights.  It's oriented slightly diagonally, with its legs toward the bottom right.


Overlapping and slightly below the chicken are several fried spring rolls, light brown and golden, arranged somewhat haphazardly. There are at least three visible, but there may be more hidden underneath.


In the upper left is a small portion of a fresh salad consisting of shredded carrots and light green lettuce leaves. A small white ramekin, filled with a dark amber-colored sauce (possibly soy sauce or a similar dipping sauce), sits next to the spring rolls and slightly behind the salad.


The background is softly blurred but suggests a table setting; a hint of a warm brown tone is visible, implying a wooden table. The overall lighting is even and bright, highlighting the textures and colors of the food. The scene gives a feeling of a well-presented meal at a restaurant or home. The focus should be sharp on the food items, especially the chicken and spring rolls, while the background remains softly out of focus.
