Generate an image of a close-up shot of several golden-brown spring rolls arranged artfully on a clean white plate.  The spring rolls should vary slightly in size and position, creating a dynamic, slightly scattered, but still organized arrangement.  Some spring rolls should be partially overlapping others.  The lighting is soft and diffused, avoiding harsh shadows, giving a warm, inviting feel. The overall style should be reminiscent of food photography, aiming for a clear, appetizing portrayal of the dish.

In the upper left corner of the plate, there's a small garnish of shredded carrots and fresh green lettuce, arranged neatly but casually. To the upper middle, slightly behind the spring rolls, a small, simple white ramekin contains a dark brown dipping sauce, its surface slightly glossy. The background is subtly blurred and out of focus; a hint of a light-brown wooden table is visible in the upper right.  The overall color palette is warm and natural, with the golden browns of the spring rolls contrasting beautifully against the white plate and fresh greens of the garnish. The depth of field should be shallow, focusing primarily on the spring rolls in the foreground. The image should have a slightly warm, inviting, and slightly glossy texture.
