Generate a pastoral landscape image in a slightly hazy, impressionistic style. The scene should depict a gently sloping hillside with a meandering dirt path cutting through a field of long, light-green grass interspersed with patches of wildflowers in yellows and oranges.

The path should lead the eye from the foreground toward a midground where a small grove of reddish-brown deciduous trees stands, providing a focal point.  Beyond the grove, the hillside continues to rise, culminating in a background of dark green coniferous forest, suggesting depth and a sense of enclosure.

The lighting should be soft and diffused, mimicking a sunny day with high clouds, casting few harsh shadows.  The overall color palette should be predominantly green and gold, with touches of reddish-brown from the trees and muted yellows and oranges from the wildflowers.  The grass should be slightly out of focus in the middle distance to create depth of field.  The style should evoke a peaceful and somewhat romantic feeling, reminiscent of impressionist landscape paintings, slightly muted and dreamlike.  The overall composition should be balanced, with the path creating a natural leading line to the grove of trees. The image should have a slightly muted, slightly desaturated look, not overly vibrant but pleasant and natural.  There's a suggestion of a thin wire fence along the upper edge of the grassy field, barely visible.
