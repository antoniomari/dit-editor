Generate an image of a sunny, pastoral scene.  The background should be a gently sloping hillside, predominantly green, with a mix of low-lying grasses and taller shrubs and trees. The trees are mostly evergreens, dark green, clustered towards the upper portion of the hillside, giving way to lighter green, smaller deciduous trees and shrubs further down. The overall impression should be one of a lush, rural landscape, possibly a meadow or parkland.  A lightly-worn, dirt path meanders from the bottom-middle of the image towards the middle-ground of the hillside.  Wildflowers, primarily yellow and muted orange, are sparsely scattered throughout the meadow, appearing more densely in clumps along the path and closer to the bottom of the image.


In the foreground, approximately centered along the path, but slightly offset to the left, place a light reddish-brown Cockapoo dog. The dog should be depicted in a playful, slightly exuberant pose, perhaps mid-stride, with its tongue slightly out, and its tail slightly raised.  The dog's fur should appear fluffy and somewhat tousled, suggesting movement. The dog should be partially obscured by the foreground grass and wildflowers, integrated naturally into the scene. The dog's size should be relatively small in comparison to the overall background.  Its presence should add a sense of life and movement to the otherwise tranquil scene, rather than jarring the overall composition. The lighting should be consistent with the overall sunny ambiance of the background. The style should be photorealistic.
