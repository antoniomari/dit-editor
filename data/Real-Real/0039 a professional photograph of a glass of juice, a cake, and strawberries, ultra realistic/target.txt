Generate an image of a white plate containing a slice of layered cake and several strawberries.  In the foreground, slightly overlapping the cake and some strawberries, is a glass of bright orange juice. The juice appears chilled, with visible ice or pulp near the top, and has a slightly imperfect, almost hand-blown, glass shape. The glass is roughly 2/3 full. The juice is vibrant and saturated, with a slight gradient of lighter color near the bottom.  The cake is rectangular, layered with light and brown colored components, and has a slightly creamy, textured look to its top layer. The strawberries are glossy and a deep red, with slight variations in shade to indicate light reflection. The overall lighting is soft and even, without harsh shadows, suggesting natural or diffused light. The scene evokes a fresh, summery feeling.  The plate is a clean, bright white, and slightly reflective.  The background is out of focus but should suggest a neutral or slightly warm background.
