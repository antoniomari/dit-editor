Generate an image of a slightly worn, light brown teddy bear sitting on a rocky outcrop.  The bear is positioned slightly off-center, facing to the right, gazing out at a vast landscape.

The teddy bear is made of a slightly fuzzy material, with visible stitching details and a small, barely noticeable blue accessory around its neck.  Its expression is neutral, almost contemplative.

The rocky outcrop is composed of light gray and brown stones of varying sizes and shapes, suggesting an ancient ruin or a naturally weathered formation.  There are fragments of what look like old, broken pottery or stonework scattered around the bear. The stones are rough-textured and show signs of erosion.

The background is a sun-drenched, expansive landscape under a clear blue sky.  A range of rolling hills extends to the horizon, showing a blend of light green and brown vegetation, suggesting a dry or semi-arid climate.  In the middle distance, there is a visible cliff face or canyon wall that adds depth to the scene. The lighting is bright and natural, typical of a sunny day; hard shadows are minimal, indicating that the sun is relatively high in the sky.

The overall style should be photorealistic, with attention to detail in the texture of the bear's fur, the roughness of the rocks, and the clarity of the landscape. The composition should evoke a sense of scale and solitude, with the teddy bear serving as a point of interest against the vastness of the background. The color palette should be warm and earthy, emphasizing browns, grays, and the blue of the clear sky.
