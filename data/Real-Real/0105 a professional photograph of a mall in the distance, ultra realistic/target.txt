Generate an image of a rocky, hilly landscape under a clear blue sky.  The rocks are predominantly grey and brown, varying in size and shape, appearing weathered and possibly part of an ancient ruin or natural formation. Sparse vegetation is visible in the background.

In the mid-ground, a large, imposing hotel or palace is digitally added to the scene. The building is light beige or off-white, multi-storied, with many windows and a classical architectural style. It is positioned slightly off-center, appearing to sit nestled amongst the distant hills. The building is slightly desaturated and has a somewhat surreal, almost faded quality, as if it is a digitally inserted element.  The building's appearance should blend somewhat unnaturally with the background, indicating that it's a composite.

In the foreground, a brown teddy bear sits amongst the rocks. The bear is slightly to the left of the center and facing the viewer. It's realistically textured, appearing plush and slightly worn. It is wearing a small, dark blue ribbon or tag around its neck. The bear looks towards the hotel in the distance, establishing a sense of scale and interaction between the foreground and midground elements. The bear is well-lit, contrasting with the more muted background.

The overall scene should have a slightly surreal and whimsical feel due to the juxtaposition of the ancient landscape, the imposing hotel, and the seemingly small and innocent teddy bear. The lighting should be consistent throughout, with natural sunlight illuminating the scene. The image should have a slightly grainy or textured quality, evoking the feel of a photograph rather than a digital rendering.
