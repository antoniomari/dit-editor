Generate an image of a sunny, pastoral scene.  The background should be a gently sloping hillside covered in lush green vegetation.  The hillside is predominantly a mix of low-lying shrubs and taller, darker evergreen trees, suggesting a temperate climate. There is a clear, light-brown dirt path winding up the center of the hillside from the bottom to the middle ground.  The path is slightly dusty, and the vegetation around it is slightly less dense. The overall color palette of the background should be natural, with various shades of green, yellow-green in the grassy areas, and darker greens for the trees. The lighting should suggest a bright, sunny day.

In the foreground, centered along the path, add a tri-colored corgi dog.  The corgi should be facing away from the viewer, trotting up the path. The dog should have a mostly white chest and underbelly, with brown and black patches on its back.  The dog's fur should appear somewhat fluffy and short. It should be positioned slightly below the middle of the image, so that the path extends beyond it both ahead and behind.   The dog should appear to be in motion, perhaps slightly blurred to imply movement.  The dog's presence should seamlessly blend into the background; it shouldn't appear superimposed or out of place.  The wildflowers along the path should be subtly pushed aside by the dog's passage but not dramatically altered. The overall feel should be one of a joyful, active dog enjoying a countryside walk.
