Generate a pastoral landscape image in a slightly hazy, impressionistic style.  The scene should depict a gently sloping hillside, with a dirt path winding its way from the foreground to the middle ground.  The path is bordered by tall, slightly overgrown grass that is predominantly light green and yellow-green, with splashes of muted yellow wildflowers scattered throughout.

The middle ground features a cluster of reddish-brown deciduous trees, somewhat loosely arranged, creating a natural, slightly unkempt look.  Beyond the trees, the hillside continues upward, covered with a dense mix of evergreen and deciduous trees, creating a dark green backdrop.  The trees in the background are less distinct, conveying depth and distance through atmospheric perspective.

The lighting should be soft and diffused, suggestive of a sunny day with a gentle haze in the air.  There should be a slight contrast between the brighter foreground and the somewhat darker, more shadowed background, but overall the scene should be bathed in a warm, natural light, without harsh shadows.

The overall composition should feel peaceful and serene. The path invites the viewer's eye into the scene, creating a sense of depth and leading towards the grouping of trees in the middle ground.  The slightly impressionistic style should avoid sharp lines, favoring a soft, blended appearance, with the colors and textures of the plants slightly blurred to suggest a gentle breeze.  The overall feeling should be one of calm and natural beauty.
