Generate an image of a close-up shot of a plate of crispy fried spring rolls.  The rolls should be golden brown and slightly irregular in shape, suggesting they are handmade.  They should be arranged somewhat casually, overlapping each other on a bright white, slightly glossy plate.

In the upper left corner, include a small garnish of shredded green lettuce and julienned carrots. A small white ramekin containing a dark reddish-brown dipping sauce sits near the center of the arrangement.  The sauce should appear slightly glossy and have a rich, dark hue.

The lighting should be soft and even, with no harsh shadows, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The overall style should be photorealistic with a slightly shallow depth of field, emphasizing the spring rolls in the foreground while gently blurring the background. The background should be subtly out of focus, suggesting a light-colored wooden table. The overall composition should be centered on the spring rolls, with the garnish and sauce serving as complementary elements. The image should have a slightly warm color temperature, enhancing the golden tones of the spring rolls.
