Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene.  The background should feature a typical American suburban house with a light-brown or beige exterior.  The house is situated behind a well-maintained lawn, partially enclosed by a chain-link fence. Mature trees, predominantly deciduous, surround the house, providing shade. The lawn is a lush, vibrant green, with patches of slightly drier, lighter-colored earth visible near the fence.  The overall lighting suggests daytime, likely midday or early afternoon.

In the foreground, place a single Arctic fox.  The fox should be positioned approximately in the lower center of the image, facing towards the left. It should be realistically rendered, with its thick, white fur detailed and fluffy-looking. The fox should appear calm and alert, standing naturally, not in an unnatural or forced pose. Its size should be appropriate for comparison to the scale of the house and yard in the background.  There should be a slight textural difference in the ground where the fox is standing, showing a small area of slightly more compacted, lighter colored earth.  

The fox should not appear to be interacting directly with the house or fence, maintaining a sense of being naturally placed in the environment.  The overall composition should be harmonious, with the fox appearing as a somewhat unexpected but not out-of-place addition to the suburban scene.  The focus should be sharp on the fox, with the background slightly softer, creating depth. The image style should be photorealistic.
