Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene on a slightly overcast day.  The style should be photorealistic, with a focus on natural light and subtle color variations.

The main focus is a large, well-maintained lawn of a light to medium green hue.  The grass is slightly uneven in texture, suggesting a natural, unmanicured but cared-for look. The lawn occupies the majority of the foreground and midground. In the foreground, a strip of sandy or light-brown dirt runs along the bottom edge of the image, sparsely dotted with small green plants.

In the mid-ground and background, a single-story, light brown or beige house is visible. The house is fairly simple in design, with visible windows and a slightly sloping roof.  It appears to be nestled amongst mature deciduous trees that are in full leaf, suggesting springtime or early summer.  The leaves are predominantly shades of green, with some darker greens and hints of yellow-green. The trees are not perfectly manicured but appear to be healthy and established.  There's a chain link fence separating the yard from what appears to be neighboring properties or the street.  A small section of another house is partially visible to the right of the main house.  Near the house, some subtle landscaping (shrubs or bushes) can be seen.


The lighting is soft and diffused, typical of an overcast day, avoiding harsh shadows. There's a gentle even light illuminating the scene, ensuring that all elements are clearly visible. The overall color palette is muted and natural, dominated by greens and browns. The image should have a slightly cool tone. The composition is relatively simple, with a wide-angle view emphasizing the expansive lawn and the house set back within the lush greenery. The perspective is from a slightly low vantage point, looking across the lawn towards the house.
