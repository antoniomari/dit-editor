Generate a digital image of a scene depicting a slice of tiramisu cake on a white plate surrounded by fresh strawberries.

**Scene:** The main focus is a single, generously sized slice of tiramisu. The cake should have two distinct layers of coffee-soaked ladyfingers visible, separated by a layer of creamy mascarpone filling. The top is coated with a glossy, translucent layer of a light cream or white glaze.  A small dark brown coffee bean is visible on the glaze near the top edge. The strawberries surrounding the cake are ripe, red, and glossy, arranged somewhat artfully but casually, not perfectly symmetrical.  A few strawberries are partially overlapping each other.  The plate is a simple, clean, bright white rectangular plate.

**Lighting:** The lighting should be soft and diffused, avoiding harsh shadows.  It should enhance the glossy sheen of the cake glaze and the vibrancy of the strawberries. Aim for a warm, inviting, slightly intimate mood,  like soft, natural light from a window on a slightly overcast day.

**Style:**  The style should be photorealistic, aiming for high detail and accuracy in texture and color. The overall feel should be clean, elegant, and appetizing.  Think high-quality food photography.

**Composition:** The tiramisu slice should be slightly off-center, creating a visually pleasing asymmetry. The strawberries should be arranged to visually lead the eye towards the cake, creating a natural frame around it. The overall composition should be balanced and uncluttered, allowing the cake and strawberries to be the clear focal points.  The plate is centrally located within the frame. A portion of a blurred background is also acceptable.  This background should be very soft, out-of-focus, and neutral in color, possibly a light beige or off-white wall.  Nothing should distract from the main subject.
