Generate an image of a white rectangular plate holding a slice of tiramisu cake.  The cake is positioned slightly off-center, leaning towards the lower-right. It's a three-layered cake with visible coffee-soaked ladyfingers and a creamy, light-colored mousse or custard filling. The top is glazed with a clear, glossy coating, and a dark object (possibly a coffee bean) is visible near the top edge of the slice.

Surrounding the cake are several fresh strawberries.  They are arranged somewhat haphazardly around the cake but generally clustered around the left and right sides of the plate. The strawberries are ripe and red, with variations in shape and size, indicative of natural produce.

A wedge of lemon is placed in the lower right quadrant, slightly overlapping the strawberries and positioned to create a nice contrast in color and texture next to the cake. The lemon is bright yellow, its flesh visible within the wedge. It is juicy-looking and slightly curved in a natural shape.

The overall lighting should be soft and even, enhancing the textures and colors of the cake, strawberries, and lemon.  The plate is clean and bright white, providing a stark contrast to the vibrant colors of the fruit and the rich tones of the cake.  The background should be a simple, unfocused, slightly out-of-focus neutral background to keep focus on the plate. The scene should give the impression of a dessert presentation, simple yet appealing.
