Generate an image of a tranquil waterfront scene at sunset.  The background should be a wide shot of a long bridge spanning a calm body of water, with a city skyline visible in the distance.  The city should include several buildings of varying heights, at least one of which is a tall, rectangular high-rise building. The sky should be a dramatic blend of sunset colors— oranges, pinks, and purples— with clouds that are both light and dark, creating a moody yet peaceful atmosphere.  The water should be relatively still, reflecting the sky and city lights faintly. The shoreline where the water meets the land should be a sandy beach.


In the foreground, place a single eastern gray squirrel. The squirrel should be positioned near the lower-center of the frame, on the sandy beach, facing towards the right. Its fur should appear realistically textured, with a mixture of gray and brown tones. The squirrel should be sitting in a natural pose, seemingly unconcerned with the cityscape behind it. It should be slightly below the horizontal midpoint of the image, creating a clear distinction between the background and foreground elements. There should be no artificial shadows created by the squirrel; integrate the squirrel seamlessly into the beach's lighting. The lighting on the squirrel should match the overall ambient sunset lighting. The focus should be primarily on the squirrel and the overall calming nature of the scene, with the bridge and cityscape serving as a beautiful backdrop, not a distracting element. The squirrel should not be overly large, maintaining a natural size relative to the foreground's scale.
