Generate an image of a tranquil waterfront scene at sunset or sunrise.  The style should be photorealistic, with a slightly muted color palette emphasizing the natural tones of the sky and sand.  The overall composition should be a long shot, with the foreground dominated by a sandy beach that extends from the bottom of the frame towards the middle.

The middle ground features a calm body of water, appearing almost glassy due to a long exposure effect. A large, modern bridge spans the water, its silhouette stark against the sky. The bridge should be detailed enough to show its structure but not overly prominent.

In the background, a city skyline is visible, with a prominent high-rise building slightly off-center to the right. The building should be a dark, neutral color. Other buildings should be present, but less distinct, creating a sense of urban depth without being overwhelming.

The sky should be the most dramatic element. It should be a blend of soft pastel colors at the horizon (perhaps pale oranges and pinks) transitioning to deeper blues and grays toward the top.  There should be a mix of clouds, some fluffy and lighter-colored, others darker and more textured, conveying a peaceful yet slightly dramatic atmosphere.  The lighting should suggest either the soft light of sunrise or the fading light of sunset.

The overall mood should be serene and peaceful, with a focus on the interplay of natural elements (sky, water, sand) and the man-made structures of the bridge and city in the distance.  The image should have a slightly desaturated, almost nostalgic feeling. The grain of the sand in the foreground should be subtly noticeable, adding to the textural richness.
