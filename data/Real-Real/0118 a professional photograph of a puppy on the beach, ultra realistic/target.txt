Generate an image of a sandy beach at sunset.  The beach is situated in the foreground, with a calm body of water stretching across the middle ground.  In the distance, a long bridge spans the width of the image, connecting to a cityscape featuring several buildings, including a prominent high-rise building on the right. The sky is a dramatic blend of sunset hues – oranges, pinks, and purples – with darker, brooding clouds.

In the foreground of the beach, positioned slightly off-center, is a small, fluffy, white chihuahua puppy. The puppy is sitting down, appearing calm and slightly contemplative. Its fur is light and appears soft. The puppy is sharply in focus, contrasting with the slightly softer focus of the background scene. It should look like it's a natural part of the beach scene.

The overall lighting of the image should match the sunset, creating a warm, slightly melancholic atmosphere. The color palette should be rich and slightly muted. The image should have a high level of detail, especially in the puppy's fur and the texture of the sand.  The bridge and buildings should be clearly visible but not so sharp as to distract from the puppy.  The water should have a gentle, reflective quality, mirroring the colors of the sky.
