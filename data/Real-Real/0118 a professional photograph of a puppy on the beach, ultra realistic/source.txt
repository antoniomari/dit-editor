Generate an image of a serene coastal scene at sunset.

**Scene:** The main focus is a long, modern bridge spanning a calm body of water.  The bridge is relatively low to the water, and appears to be a lift bridge or drawbridge design, with visible support structures. Beyond the bridge, a cityscape is visible, featuring a prominent, somewhat boxy high-rise building to the right, with a few smaller buildings behind it. The city skyline is not overly dense.  In the foreground is a gently sloping sandy beach, composed of small, dark-colored pebbles or sand, extending from the bottom of the frame towards the water.  A few small boats or vessels are subtly visible on the water near the bridge.


**Lighting:** The scene is bathed in the soft, warm light of a late sunset or early sunrise. The sky should display a blend of warm oranges and pinks near the horizon, gradually transitioning to cooler blues and purples higher up. There are some scattered clouds that are brightly lit by the setting sun, creating a dramatic yet peaceful atmosphere. The overall lighting should be slightly diffused, avoiding harsh shadows. The reflection of the sunset should be visible, though subtle, in the calm water.

**Style:** The image should have a slightly desaturated, almost vintage or film-like quality.  The colors should be slightly muted, enhancing the tranquil and nostalgic feel. The overall impression should be realistic, but with a touch of artistic enhancement, maybe leaning towards a slightly painterly style.  The focus should be on the overall mood and the interplay of light and shadow.  The image should have a widescreen cinematic feel to it, with the bridge being the central visual element.


**Composition:** The image should adopt a low angle perspective from the sandy beach, looking out towards the bridge and city. The foreground should be sharply focused, while the background elements (bridge and city) are slightly less sharp to create depth. The rule of thirds should be considered for balancing the elements within the frame. The water should be relatively calm, reflecting the sky and bridge subtly. The horizon should be positioned somewhat low in the frame, emphasizing the vastness of the sky and the expansive water.
