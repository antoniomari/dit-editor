Generate an image of a scene featuring a slice of tiramisu cake and fresh strawberries arranged on a white plate.

**Scene:** The main focus is a single, elegantly presented slice of tiramisu cake. The cake should have two distinct layers of coffee-soaked ladyfingers visible, sandwiched between layers of creamy mascarpone cheese.  The top is coated with a glossy, light-colored glaze, possibly with a hint of coffee or berry color, and a small, dark coffee bean visible on top.  Surrounding the cake are several fresh, ripe strawberries, arranged artfully but naturally, not perfectly symmetrical.  Some strawberries are whole, others slightly overlapping, creating a sense of casual elegance. The plate is plain, bright white, oval or slightly rectangular in shape, and subtly reflects the soft light.

**Lighting:** The lighting should be soft and diffused, likely from a slightly overhead source, avoiding harsh shadows.  The light should gently highlight the glossy top of the cake and the glistening surfaces of the strawberries, making them look appetizing.  The background should be softly illuminated, out of focus and neutral (a pale, off-white or light beige).

**Style:** The overall style should be clean, minimalistic, and elegant, evoking a feeling of sophisticated simplicity.  The image should have a high level of detail, making the texture of the cake (the airy mascarpone and the slightly rough ladyfingers) and the fine details of the strawberries (the seeds, the subtle variations in color) clearly visible.   The photo should appear to be professionally taken, with good focus and depth of field, blurring the background subtly.

**Composition:** The cake should be positioned slightly off-center, creating visual balance with the strawberries arranged around it. The strawberries should be distributed across the plate in a way that guides the viewer's eye to the cake, creating a harmonious visual flow.  The composition should feel naturally elegant and inviting, rather than overly staged. The perspective is slightly high angle, looking down onto the plate.

The overall image should be visually appealing and high-quality, capturing the deliciousness of the cake and the freshness of the strawberries.  The colors should be naturally vibrant but not oversaturated.
