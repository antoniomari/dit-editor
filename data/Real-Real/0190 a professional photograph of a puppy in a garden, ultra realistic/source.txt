Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene on a slightly overcast day.  The style should be photorealistic, with natural colors and textures.

**Scene:** The main focus is a large, well-maintained lawn occupying the majority of the frame. This lawn is a vibrant, slightly uneven green, suggesting it's naturally grown, not perfectly manicured. In the middle ground, situated about a third of the way back, is a single-story house. The house is a light brownish-grey, with a simple, somewhat dated design.  It features a gabled roof and visible windows.  Behind the house, there are additional trees and possibly another structure partially visible. To the left, partially obscured by trees and fence, is a corner of another house or building.  A chain link fence runs along the left side of the lawn, separating the property from a neighboring yard.  There's some sparse, light brown, almost sandy soil visible in the immediate foreground.  A few small weeds or patches of grass are sparsely scattered across this foreground area. Some shrubs and more trees are situated behind the house.

**Lighting:** The lighting should be soft and diffused, suggesting an overcast day.  There are no harsh shadows, and the overall tone is evenly lit, with a slightly cool color temperature.

**Composition:** The perspective is from a low vantage point, looking towards the house and lawn. The composition is simple and straightforward, with the lawn leading the eye to the house in the background.  The trees provide depth and frame the scene.

**Details:**  The trees are lush and green, with a mix of deciduous trees with full foliage, indicating spring or summer. The grass has a slightly longer, more natural look, not perfectly trimmed. The fence is a simple, utilitarian metal chain link fence. The details should be realistic, including the textures of grass, bark, and soil.  There might be a faint suggestion of power lines running horizontally across the top middle of the image.  There is a hint of some objects in the background near the house, potentially patio furniture or other outdoor items but not clearly defined.
