Generate an image of a lush green hillside scene.  The hillside is characterized by a gently sloping path that meanders from the foreground towards the background.  The path is dirt, light brown in color, and slightly worn. The hillside is covered in a mix of short, grassy vegetation and taller, flowering plants. The vegetation is a vibrant green, with patches of yellow wildflowers scattered throughout.  In the background, there's a dense forest of evergreen trees on a higher elevation.  The overall lighting suggests a sunny day.


The foreground element is a giant panda lying on its side on the grassy path. The panda is positioned roughly in the center of the image, slightly off-center towards the left.  Its body is relaxed, limbs sprawled out naturally. The panda's fur is realistically rendered, showing black and white markings with a glossy sheen. It should be integrated seamlessly into the scene, casting a slight shadow on the grass beneath. The panda's placement adds a sense of unexpected tranquility to the otherwise serene landscape.  It does not appear to be interacting directly with any other elements besides resting on the ground. The background scene is otherwise unaltered, only the panda is added.
