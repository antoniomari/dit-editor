Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene on an overcast day.  The style should be photorealistic, with a slightly muted color palette.

The main focus is a large, neatly mown lawn occupying most of the foreground and middle ground. The lawn is a vibrant, yet slightly desaturated, green, showing subtle variations in texture and color.  Some sparse, light-brown patches are visible in the immediate foreground, suggesting dry or sandy soil.

In the mid-ground, beyond the lawn, is a modest, single-story ranch-style house with a brown roof. The house is slightly faded in appearance, suggesting age or weathering.  Its details should be relatively muted – no strong contrasting colors or sharp highlights. The windows should appear relatively plain.   There's a short fence separating the house's yard from the main lawn. Partially visible behind a chain link fence to the left of the house is another house and a sliver of what looks like a carport or garage.

Surrounding the house and lawn are mature deciduous trees, mostly leafy, with a predominantly green canopy, suggesting spring or early summer. The trees provide a natural frame around the house, their branches slightly obscuring parts of the structures. The trees should show variations in leaf density and depth. The lighting should be even and soft, characteristic of an overcast day – no harsh shadows or bright highlights.  A single power line runs horizontally across the scene at a mid-level, above the tree line.

In the background, beyond the house, there's a hint of more trees and a hint of possibly other houses, but these elements should be blurred and less distinct than the main house and immediate surroundings.

Overall composition should be a wide shot, emphasizing the expanse of the lawn and the peaceful, somewhat quiet suburban atmosphere. The image should feel serene and natural, without any overtly dramatic elements. The perspective should be from a slightly low angle, viewing the scene as if from a sitting position or the slight elevation of the foreground’s sandy area.
