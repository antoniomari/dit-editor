Generate an image of a suburban backyard scene.  The background should be a typical suburban backyard with a well-maintained lawn.  In the middle ground, there is a single-story house, light brown or beige in color, with large windows and mature trees surrounding it. A chain-link fence runs partially along the edge of the yard.  The lawn is a vibrant green, and some patches of light brown dirt or sand are visible near the bottom of the frame.

The foreground element is a West Highland White Terrier, also known as a Westie. The dog is positioned near the bottom center of the image, sitting on a patch of light brown sand/dirt. The dog should appear to be looking directly at the viewer. It should be realistically rendered with detailed fur and accurate coloring. The dog should be in sharp focus, contrasting slightly with the softer focus on the background elements to emphasize its placement in the foreground. The overall lighting should be consistent with an outdoor daylight scene. The addition of the dog does not alter the background significantly; it simply adds a cute, foreground element to an otherwise normal backyard.
