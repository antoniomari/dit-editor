Generate an image that composes a giant panda bear in the foreground with a background reminiscent of Vincent van Gogh's painting style, specifically focusing on his use of color and brushstrokes.

**Foreground:** A large, adult giant panda bear, rendered with realistic fur texture, is positioned centrally in the lower third of the image.  The panda is walking or ambling, its head slightly lowered, giving a calm and somewhat contemplative pose. The panda should be in sharp focus, contrasting with the slightly softer focus of the background.

**Background:** The background should be an interpretation of a Van Gogh-esque landscape. The style should be immediately recognizable as Van Gogh's work, employing thick, visible brushstrokes, and impasto technique. Use a palette of blues and greens for the sky and grass, with hints of yellow and white for flowers in the field. Depict a landscape with a row of stylized, slightly abstract trees in the mid-ground, using varying shades of green and brown. A sky filled with large, swirling clouds rendered with varied shades of blues, purples and grays with visible texture.  The sky should occupy the upper half of the image and dominate the color palette. There should be a small, low-lying building, almost indistinct, in the far midground behind the trees.

**Interaction:** The panda is positioned in a grassy field in the lower third of the image. The panda's size should be noticeably large in comparison to the scale of the trees and the building in the background. The panda should be seamlessly integrated into the image, so the lighting and shadowing should feel cohesive with the background;  avoid a jarring juxtaposition. The backgroundâ€™s style will contrast with the realistic rendering of the panda. The green field where the panda sits provides a smooth transition between the realistic animal and the expressive painting style of the background.

**Overall Scene:** The overall scene should create a surreal and intriguing juxtaposition between the photorealistic panda and the expressive, artistic background, resulting in a harmonious yet unexpected composition. The impact should be a whimsical, memorable image with artistic merit and a blend of realism and impressionism.
