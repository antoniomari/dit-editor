Generate an image of a cityscape reflected in calm water.  The style should be reminiscent of a slightly impressionistic painting, with visible brushstrokes and a soft, muted color palette. The overall color scheme should be dominated by pale blues, greens, and muted pinks and oranges.


**Background:**

The background is a hazy, pale blue sky, suggesting a calm, possibly overcast day.  There's a subtle textural effect throughout the background, resembling faint brushstrokes or a textured canvas. The horizon line should be approximately one-third of the way up from the bottom of the image.

**Foreground Element:**

The foreground element is a composite of several buildings, appearing as if a large city block has been carefully placed in front of the background.  The central focus is a large, pale-green rectangular building (possibly a hotel) with numerous evenly spaced windows.  This building is slightly elevated above the waterline, as if floating just above it. To the left of this central building, there are smaller buildings of varying heights and shapes, including one that resembles a tower. To the right, the buildings are slightly less defined but maintain a consistent architectural style. On top of the main building, there is a text which reads "OFFICE". The buildings are rendered with a similar painterly style to the background, maintaining consistency and a unified feel.

**Interaction:**

The buildings sit on a narrow strip of stylized greenery that is represented by short, stylized strokes of green and hints of other colors. Small boats are subtly present, partially obscured by the building's placement, sitting in the water in front of the main cityscape structure. The buildings' reflection is visible in the calm water, creating a mirroring effect. The reflection should be slightly less defined than the buildings themselves, adding to the soft, painterly aesthetic. The reflection should not be a perfect mirror image, but rather a slightly blurred and diffused version, incorporating the color palette of the water.


**Overall Scene Changes:**

The addition of the building complex significantly changes the background scene.  It transforms an otherwise simple sky and horizon line into a complex cityscape view. The buildings' insertion should feel almost as if they are a collage element, with some parts seemingly slightly out of scale, enhancing the artistic style.  The effect should be deliberate, contributing to the overall impressionistic and slightly surreal feel of the piece. The calm water and soft colors emphasize the sense of tranquility, despite the urban complexity added to the scene.
