Generate an image in the style of Vincent van Gogh, depicting a landscape scene under a dramatic sky.

**Scene:** The foreground is a vibrant green field speckled with small, colorful wildflowers.  A thin, dark line suggests a boundary separating the field from a row of trees and a distant building.  Several prominent, stylized trees with fluffy, somewhat rounded crowns stand out against the background, showing touches of pink and white blossoms.  Behind the foreground field is a line of smaller, less detailed trees bordering a horizon line.  A brick-orange building is visible in the mid-ground.

**Sky:** The sky dominates the upper two-thirds of the image.  It is filled with large, expressive clouds painted with visible brushstrokes. The clouds are predominantly shades of grey-purple and bluish-grey, with lighter areas suggesting the break between clouds and sky. The clouds are dynamic, swirling, and textured, conveying a sense of movement and perhaps impending weather.  Some faint vertical strokes might suggest a light rain or drizzle.


**Lighting:** The lighting is diffuse, likely an overcast day. There are no harsh shadows, giving a soft, evenly lit quality to the entire scene, although the clouds themselves have variations in light and shade.


**Style:** The style should be distinctly Van Gogh.  The brushstrokes should be visible, thick, and impasto, with visible texture. The colors should be bold and slightly exaggerated, yet also naturalistic in their overall effect. The trees are stylized with a characteristic van Gogh-like boldness and simplification, capturing the essence of their forms rather than photorealistic detail. The clouds should emulate his dynamic and expressive handling of form and color.  The palette should be rich, with a balance of greens, blues, purples, oranges, and the subtle inclusion of pink from the blossoms. The overall effect should be one of visible, emotional expression and movement within the painting.


**Composition:** The composition is relatively horizontal, with the sky dominating the upper portion and the field occupying the lower portion. The placement of the trees and the distant building creates a sense of depth, leading the eye from the foreground into the middle and background. The slightly asymmetrical arrangement of the trees and the varied shapes of the clouds prevents the image from being static.
