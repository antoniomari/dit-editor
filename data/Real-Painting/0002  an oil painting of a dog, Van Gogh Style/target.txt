Generate an image of a border collie puppy lying in a field, in the style of Vincent van Gogh.  

The puppy should be in the foreground, positioned slightly off-center, lying down and looking directly at the viewer.  It should be a black and white border collie with a fluffy coat.  It should wear a light blue collar.  The puppy's fur should be rendered with visible brushstrokes, mimicking Van Gogh's impasto style.

The background should be a landscape painting reminiscent of Van Gogh's style, featuring a field of grass with visible strokes of green, yellow, and white to represent flowers.   Several stylized, expressive trees with visible brushstrokes are present in the mid-ground. The sky should be a dramatic blue with large, swirling clouds rendered in shades of grey, purple, and blue. The clouds should have a thick, impasto texture.  The overall color palette should be vibrant yet slightly muted, to harmonize with the puppy.

The style should be distinctly Van Gogh; the brushstrokes should be visible and textured, the colors should be rich and somewhat bold, and the overall composition should have the distinctive emotional energy characteristic of Van Goghâ€™s work. The puppy should appear naturally integrated into the style of the landscape, not looking like a separate photograph pasted onto the painting.  The lighting should be consistent, making the puppy and background look like they belong together.
