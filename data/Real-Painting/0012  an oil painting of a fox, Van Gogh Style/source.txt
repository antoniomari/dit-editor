Generate an image in the style of Vincent van Gogh, depicting a landscape under a dramatic sky.

**Scene:** The scene is a pastoral landscape featuring a foreground of a vibrant green field dotted with small, colorful wildflowers.  Behind the field is a dark green line representing a hedgerow or fence. Beyond this, several blossoming willow or similar trees stand prominently against a low horizon.  A simple, rectangular building, rendered in shades of orange and blue, is visible in the mid-ground, partially obscured by the trees. Further back, a line of darker green trees stretches across the canvas.

**Sky:** The sky dominates the upper two-thirds of the composition. It is filled with large, expressive clouds rendered in swirling strokes of light purple, gray, and white, suggesting a potentially stormy yet also luminous atmosphere. The clouds are dynamic and textured, with visible brushstrokes indicating movement and depth.  There's a suggestion of a light, almost ethereal, blue between the clouds.

**Lighting:** The lighting is naturalistic but infused with the artist's emotional interpretation. The scene appears to be lit by diffuse daylight, possibly with the sun partially obscured by the clouds, resulting in a soft yet dramatic light across the landscape.  The clouds are not uniformly lit; some areas appear darker and more ominous, while others are brighter and lighter.


**Style:** The style should mimic Van Gogh's impasto technique.  Thick, visible brushstrokes are essential throughout the piece, giving the image a textured and expressive quality.  The colors should be bold and slightly saturated, with a clear emphasis on contrasts between warm and cool tones. The overall feeling should be emotional and evocative, capturing a sense of movement and energy.  Use a palette reflecting Van Gogh's typical colors: deep blues, greens, oranges, purples, and whites.  The trees and flowers should have visible and expressive individual brushstrokes.

**Composition:** The composition is primarily horizontal, with the sky occupying a significant portion of the upper part of the image, allowing the viewer's eye to move from the sky down through the trees and onto the foreground field.  The trees are strategically placed to create visual interest and a sense of rhythm.


**Overall:** The resulting image should evoke a sense of tranquility juxtaposed with the dramatic sky, showcasing the artist's signature style and use of color and texture. The emphasis should be on the emotion and energy conveyed through the brushstrokes and color choices.
