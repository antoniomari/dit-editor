Generate an image in the style of Vincent van Gogh's "Wheatfield with Cypresses."  The background should be a vibrant, impasto landscape painting featuring his characteristic swirling brushstrokes.  The sky should be dominated by large, expressive clouds in shades of grey, blue, and purple.  The lower portion of the image should depict a field of green grass speckled with small, brightly colored flowers, and several stylized cypress trees in the middle ground. A small orange building should be visible in the mid-ground.  The color palette should be bold and somewhat exaggerated, reflective of van Gogh's style.

In the foreground, place a red fox, sitting calmly and facing the viewer. The fox should be rendered with slightly more realistic detail than the background, but still retain a painterly quality. The fur should be a rich, reddish-orange color with lighter accents on its chest and underbelly. Its eyes should be alert and expressive. The fox should be positioned slightly off-center, toward the bottom of the image. The positioning should be such that it appears to be part of the van Gogh scene. There should be no obvious separation between the fox and the background.  The fox's fur should seamlessly blend with the painterly style of the background, appearing both realistic and as a part of the artistic landscape. The lighting of the fox should be consistent with the landscape's overall lighting.
