Generate an image of a stylized cityscape reminiscent of an impressionistic painting, situated along a calm body of water.  The background consists of a row of buildings rendered in a loose, painterly style. These buildings are various heights and colors, mostly pastels with hints of orange and red, and feature visible brushstrokes suggesting a textured, almost rough surface. The style is somewhat cubist, with buildings not precisely realistic in form but evocative of a cityscape. The One World Trade Center is recognizable amongst them, though it's also treated in the same painterly style as the other buildings. The sky above is a hazy light blue, suggesting a calm day. The water in the foreground is relatively still, reflecting the buildings in a muted, impressionistic way.  The water's surface is painted with subtle brushstrokes indicating gentle ripples.

The foreground element is a large, modern, grey skyscraper with a distinctive, almost sculptural, design. Its structure is unique, with irregular curves and a somewhat blocky overall shape. This building is placed slightly off-center, right of center, prominently displayed but integrated within the painterly style of the background.  It does not disrupt the overall painted style of the background but stands out because of its relative sharpness and clean lines compared to the painterly effect of the background buildings. It's almost as if this modern building has been digitally inserted into the existing painting, contrasting the painterly style of the city skyline with the sharp lines and detail of the contemporary structure.  The building should look like it's a part of the city but also distinctly different, visually "popping" slightly from the background because of a slight contrast in style and definition. The overall effect should be a blend of impressionism and contemporary architecture, creating a sense of timelessness and visual juxtaposition. The colors should be muted and harmonious, with the main emphasis on light pastel tones.
