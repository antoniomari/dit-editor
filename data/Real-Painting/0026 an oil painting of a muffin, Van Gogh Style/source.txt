Generate an image in a stylized, painterly fashion reminiscent of early 20th-century folk art.  The scene depicts a simple table setting outdoors, possibly in a garden or cafe.

**Scene:** The central focus is a table covered with a green and white checkered tablecloth. On the table are:

* **A purple teapot:** A slightly bulbous teapot with a simple spout and handle. Its color should be a rich, slightly desaturated purple.
* **A blue teacup and saucer:** A small, light blue teacup filled with dark brown tea, sitting on a matching saucer.  The teacup should have a slight curve to its form.
* **A small, brown baked good (e.g., a pudding or cake):** This is sitting on a vibrant pink saucer or small plate.  The baked good should have a slightly irregular texture.
* **A yellow mug:** A small, muted yellow mug placed slightly off to the side.
* **A knife and fork (or spoon):**  These are subtly present on the plate with the baked good, painted in a way that suggests movement or casual placement.

In the background are two simple wooden chairs, slightly blurred: one blue, the other a muted orange-brown. The chairs suggest a rustic or casual setting.  The background is somewhat indistinct, implying an outdoor setting with a suggestion of a wall or fence.  The background should be painted with loose brushstrokes emphasizing a sense of depth.

**Lighting:** The scene is lit with soft, diffused natural light, with no harsh shadows.  The light should be warm, subtly illuminating the objects on the table.

**Style:** The overall style should be bold and colorful, yet somewhat naive in its execution.  Think of thick, visible brushstrokes, slightly uneven lines, and a simplified representation of forms. The colors should be slightly muted, but still rich and expressive. There's a flatness to the painting that doesn't focus on sharp perspective, leaning instead on the expressive use of color and texture.


**Composition:** The objects on the table are arranged asymmetrically, creating a sense of casualness and informality. The chairs in the background frame the scene, drawing the eye to the central group of objects.  The overall composition should feel balanced and pleasant, inviting a sense of quiet domesticity.
