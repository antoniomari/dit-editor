Generate an image in the style of a vibrant, slightly naive painting, reminiscent of children's book illustrations or folk art.  The scene depicts a simple table setting on a green checkered tablecloth.

**Scene:** The table holds a light blue teacup and saucer filled with dark brown tea, a purple teapot, a small orange-brown cake or pastry on a pink plate with a knife and napkin, and a mustard-yellow mug to the left.  Two simple wooden chairs, one blue and one orange-brown, are visible in the background.

**Lighting:** The lighting is soft and diffused, casting gentle shadows that aren't harsh or overly realistic.  The light seems to come from above and slightly in front, illuminating the scene evenly without strong highlights or dramatic contrasts.

**Style:** The style should be painterly, with visible brushstrokes.  The colors are bold and slightly unrealistic, but harmoniously balanced.  There's a charming simplicity and lack of detail, as if the image were created with broad strokes and a focus on color and shapes rather than precise realism.  The edges of the objects are slightly fuzzy and unrefined, contributing to the overall playful aesthetic. The texture should be slightly rough, giving the impression of paint on canvas.  The background wall should be depicted with a textured, mottled gray pattern, suggesting a slightly aged surface.

**Composition:** The composition should be centered, with the tea set and cake positioned to draw the eye towards the center of the image.  The chairs in the background provide a sense of depth and context without distracting from the main focus on the table. The tablecloth's pattern adds visual interest without overpowering the scene.

Overall, the image should evoke a feeling of warmth, simplicity, and quiet domesticity, with a distinct painterly style that embraces imperfection and charming naivete.
