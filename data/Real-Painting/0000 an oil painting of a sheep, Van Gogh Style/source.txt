Generate an image in the style of Vincent van Gogh, specifically mimicking his impasto technique and expressive brushstrokes.  The scene is a landscape featuring a vibrant green field in the foreground, speckled with small, colorful flowers rendered with short, visible brushstrokes of varying colors (greens, yellows, whites, hints of orange and purple).

The midground shows a dark green line representing a hedgerow or low fence separating the field from a row of blossoming trees. These trees are stylized, not photorealistic, with visible brushstrokes suggesting their texture and leafiness.  The color palette for the trees includes various greens, hints of pink blossoms, and touches of darker brown for the branches.  Three or four prominent trees stand slightly taller than the others. Behind the trees is a low building; a reddish-orange structure with hints of dark blue/purple, represented with thick, distinct brushstrokes.

The background is dominated by a dramatic, swirling sky filled with large, expressive clouds. These clouds are rendered with dynamic, swirling brushstrokes of light and dark blues, grays, and purples.  The clouds should convey a sense of movement, perhaps suggesting a slight storm or approaching rain. There's a sense of lightness in the sky's overall hue despite the darkness of the clouds, indicating a sky that is partly clear.

The overall lighting should be natural daylight, with the sun potentially slightly obscured by the clouds. The colors should be vivid and slightly exaggerated, characteristic of Van Gogh's style. The composition should feel balanced, with the foreground field grounding the eye, and the dramatic sky creating a sense of scale and grandeur.  The brushstrokes throughout the image should be clearly visible and intentional, contributing to the overall texture and emotional impact of the piece.  Aim for a slightly low horizon line to emphasize the expansiveness of the sky.
