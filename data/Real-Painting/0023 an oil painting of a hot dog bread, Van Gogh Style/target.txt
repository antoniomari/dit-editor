Generate an image of a whimsical, painterly still life.  The background is a stylized depiction of a table setting in a caf√©.  Two simple wooden chairs, one blue and one brown-orange, are positioned behind the table. The table is a mottled green with a grid-like texture, suggesting brushstrokes of various shades of green,  yellow-green and hints of beige.  A purple teapot sits on the table, slightly angled to the left. Next to it is a blue teacup and saucer with dark brown tea inside. To the left of this, a yellow mug sits partially obscured. All items are rendered in a slightly naive, painterly style, with visible brushstrokes.


The foreground element is a Coney Island-style hot dog, heavily laden with chili, onions, and mustard.  The hot dog is placed on a pink and white patterned plate, slightly off-center to the right. The plate is not perfectly aligned with the table's geometry and sits slightly forward. The hot dog itself is positioned with a slight diagonal from the upper right to lower left, making it visually prominent. The chili is rich dark brown, and the bun is a light tan, contrasting against the plate and the overall green tones of the table.  The style of the hot dog should match the painterly quality of the rest of the image; visible brush strokes are welcome.


The overall effect should be a slightly surreal and humorous juxtaposition of the refined tea setting with the casual, almost messy, presence of the hot dog. The hot dog's placement should feel slightly unexpected and out of place within the otherwise serene scene. The image should maintain a consistent painterly style throughout, with visible brushstrokes and a slightly imperfect, hand-crafted look.  The color palette should be somewhat muted, focusing on the greens, blues, browns, and the rich brown of the chili, contrasted by the purple teapot and the pink tones of the plate.
