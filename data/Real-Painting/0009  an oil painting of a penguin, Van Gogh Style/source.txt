Generate an image in the style of Vincent van Gogh, specifically emulating his use of impasto and expressive brushstrokes. The scene is a landscape featuring a field of vibrant green grass speckled with small, colorful wildflowers.  The field occupies the lower third of the image.

In the midground, a dark green line represents a low fence or border separating the field from a line of trees.  These trees are depicted with short, thick, visible brushstrokes, suggesting willow or similar types of trees. Some trees are taller and more prominent than others, with a few positioned more centrally than others.  Behind the trees is a small, simple building, rendered in a boxy shape with tones of blue and orange/red.

The upper two-thirds of the image are dominated by a dramatic, swirling sky filled with large, expressive clouds.  These clouds are painted with thick, impasto brushstrokes in shades of light blue, grey, and purple. The clouds are dynamic and almost seem to be moving, with varying densities and shapes. Some wisps of lighter blue peek through the thicker areas of cloud, creating a sense of depth and movement.  A slight suggestion of rain or drizzle might be subtly implied in the sky, but this should not be overtly detailed.

The overall lighting is bright, with a cool light illuminating the scene, hinting at an overcast day, but not a completely gloomy one.  The colors should be relatively saturated but still maintain a natural feel, consistent with van Gogh's palette.  The composition should be horizontal, emphasizing the breadth of the landscape and the vastness of the sky. The style should be highly textural, with visible brushstrokes that contribute to the overall emotion and energy of the piece. The perspective should be relatively flat, characteristic of Post-Impressionism.
