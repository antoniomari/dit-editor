Generate an image in the style of Vincent van Gogh's "Wheatfield with Cypresses."  The background should be a landscape painting reminiscent of his style: a vibrant blue sky filled with thick, swirling clouds rendered in shades of blue, purple, and grey.  These clouds should be impasto in style, with visible brushstrokes. The ground should be a field of green grass with scattered wildflowers, depicted with short, visible brushstrokes and a textured appearance. In the mid-ground, include several stylized cypress trees characteristic of Van Gogh, rendered with dark, curving brushstrokes. A simple building, possibly orange or red, is present in the mid-ground.

In the foreground, place a baby elephant. The elephant should be dark grey or bluish-grey, almost appearing wrinkled or textured, as if it were rendered with the same impasto technique as the background.  Its skin should have slight variations in tone. Its ears should be relatively large, and its trunk should be gently lowered towards the ground. The elephant should be positioned slightly off-center, grazing or walking calmly in the field.   The elephant's placement should be such that it doesn't overly disrupt the existing flow of the background painting, but rather feels like a natural, albeit unusual, addition to the scene.  The lighting should be consistent with the overall lighting of the Van Gogh-inspired background.  There should be no harsh shadows, only soft transitions of light and shadow consistent with the general impressionistic nature of the scene. The overall mood should be serene and slightly surreal.
