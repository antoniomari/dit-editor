Generate an image of a stylized cityscape reminiscent of the New York City skyline, rendered in a painterly, impressionistic style.

**Scene:** The scene depicts a waterfront view of a city skyline, with numerous skyscrapers of varying heights and architectural styles.  The One World Trade Center is prominently featured as a taller, slender building.  The buildings are clustered together, creating a dense urban feel.  A calm body of water sits in the foreground, reflecting the city's muted colors. Hints of greenery are present at the base of the buildings along the waterfront. A few small boats are visible on the water.


**Lighting:** The lighting is soft and diffused, suggesting a slightly overcast day or soft morning/evening light. There are no harsh shadows; the overall illumination is even across the scene. The light is muted, without strong contrasts.


**Style:** The style should be impressionistic and painterly.  Brushstrokes should be visible and expressive, contributing to the overall texture of the image. The colors are somewhat muted and pastel-like; think light blues, soft pinks, creams, and subtle grays and oranges in the buildings. The building forms are slightly abstracted, not perfectly geometric. The overall look should be reminiscent of a loose, expressive oil painting.


**Composition:** The composition is a horizontal panorama, with the cityscape dominating the central and background area, and the calm water occupying the foreground, roughly a third of the space. The One World Trade Center acts as a visual anchor, drawing the eye towards the center.  The buildings are slightly varied in height and color but generally arranged in a somewhat linear fashion along the waterfront.  The colors are harmonious and the whole scene should create a feeling of tranquility. The sky is a pale, almost washed-out blue.


The overall effect should be serene, beautiful, and reminiscent of an artistic interpretation of a familiar cityscape, not a photorealistic depiction. Avoid sharp lines and hard edges; focus on a soft, expressive, textured quality throughout.
