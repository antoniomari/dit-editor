Generate an image in the style of Vincent van Gogh.  The background should be a landscape featuring his characteristic swirling, impasto brushstrokes.  The sky should be a vibrant blue filled with large, puffy clouds rendered in shades of purple, grey, and white, with visible brushstrokes. The clouds should dominate the upper two-thirds of the image.  The lower third should show a grassy field with small, flowering plants depicted with short, visible brushstrokes of various greens and yellows.  Several stylized trees, reminiscent of Van Gogh's work, should be scattered across the landscape, their branches and leaves textured with thick, visible brushstrokes.  A small, orange-red building should be visible in the mid-ground.

In the foreground, centered slightly to the left, place a realistic grey squirrel.  The squirrel should be sitting on the grassy field, facing right, its body slightly turned away from the viewer. Its fur should be highly detailed and contrasted against the painterly background.  The squirrel should be realistically rendered, but not photorealistic, so that it doesn't clash too harshly with Van Gogh's style.  The squirrel's presence should subtly alter the color scheme of the immediate area around it, but the overall Van Gogh style and color palette of the background should remain dominant.  The overall effect should be a playful juxtaposition of realism and Impressionism, with the squirrel appearing to exist within the painted world of Van Gogh.
