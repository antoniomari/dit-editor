Generate an image in the style of Vincent van Gogh, depicting a landscape under a dramatic sky.

**Scene:** The scene is a pastoral landscape featuring a foreground of a vibrant green field speckled with small, brightly colored flowers.  A line of dark green trees and shrubs separates the field from a middle ground showing a low, flat orange-red building, possibly a barn or farmhouse, partially obscured behind some leafy trees.  Several prominent, stylized, almost pom-pom-like trees are scattered across the scene, particularly noticeable in the middle ground.   Some dark green, almost cypress-like trees are visible on the far right.

**Sky:** The sky dominates the upper two-thirds of the composition and is filled with large, expressive clouds rendered in swirling strokes of pale blue, grey, purple and white.  The clouds are dynamic and appear to be moving, possibly suggesting a breezy or stormy atmosphere.  Thereâ€™s a sense of depth to the clouds, with some appearing darker and more textured than others.

**Lighting:** The light appears to be diffused, perhaps an overcast day, with no harsh shadows. The colors are rich and saturated, even though the overall lighting is soft.  The light seems to come from above, illuminating the clouds and reflecting softly on the field.

**Style:** The overall style should mimic Van Gogh's distinctive impasto technique.  The brushstrokes should be visible, thick, and expressive, creating texture and movement throughout the image.  The colors should be bold and slightly exaggerated, reflecting Van Gogh's use of color to convey emotion and energy.  The trees and flowers should have a slightly stylized, almost symbolic quality. The lines are not geometric; rather, they are expressive and slightly distorted.

**Composition:** The composition should be balanced, with the dramatic sky contrasting with the peaceful landscape below. The horizontal line of the field separates the sky and land, creating a clear visual division. The strategically placed trees in the middle ground create a rhythmic visual flow across the composition.  The use of color and brushwork should guide the viewer's eye from the dynamic sky down to the more tranquil landscape.
