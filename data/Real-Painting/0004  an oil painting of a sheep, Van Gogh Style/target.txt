Generate an image in the style of Vincent van Gogh's "Wheatfield with Cypresses."  The background should be a vibrant, impasto landscape reminiscent of his style, featuring a blue sky filled with expressive, swirling clouds painted in shades of grey, blue, and hints of yellow.  The clouds should have a heavy, textured appearance.  The ground should be a field of green grass with small, scattered flowers in various colors (mostly yellows, whites, and oranges), rendered with visible brushstrokes. The field should contain several characteristic stylized Van Gogh trees, dark in color with short, slightly bushy tops.  A small orange-brown building can be seen in the middle-ground, with the details of the building less focused than the landscape around it.

In the foreground, place a single, fluffy white sheep. It should be positioned slightly off-center, facing to the left, and appear to be grazing peacefully in the field. The sheep should be realistically rendered in contrast to the more impressionistic background; its wool should be textured and appear soft.   Its positioning should be such that it interacts with the foreground without obscuring a significant amount of the background elements or trees. The sheep shouldnâ€™t be too large or small relative to the landscape elements; it should fit naturally within the scale of the scene.


The overall effect should be a juxtaposition of a realistic element (the sheep) within a highly stylized, emotionally evocative impressionistic background.  The sheep should appear to be at peace within this dramatic landscape; the contrast should be subtle but striking.  The color palette should be consistent with Van Gogh's typical use of bold, slightly unnatural colors that convey emotion.
