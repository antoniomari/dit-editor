Generate an image that composites a giant panda cub onto a background of a painting in the style of Vincent van Gogh.

The background should be a landscape in Van Gogh's characteristic impasto style, with thick, visible brushstrokes.  The sky should be dominated by large, swirling clouds in shades of blue, grey, and purple.  The ground should be a field of green, dotted with small, stylized flowers and a few thin, dark-green trees with visible brushstrokes.  In the mid-ground, include a small, orange-ish building.  The overall color palette should be vibrant, slightly muted, and reminiscent of Van Gogh's "Wheatfield with Cypresses" or similar works.  

The foreground element is a single, realistically rendered giant panda cub. The cub should be positioned in the lower center of the image, slightly facing toward the viewer,  sitting in the grassy field.  Its fur should be meticulously detailed, contrasting sharply with the painterly style of the background.  The panda appears to be calmly sitting on the ground of the Van Gogh landscape, with no visible interaction with the background besides its placement within it.  The panda's presence subtly alters the mood of the original scene.  The original Van Gogh style scene has a sense of dramatic movement and turbulent sky; the presence of the peaceful panda softens this slightly, adding an element of unexpected calm and cuteness to the otherwise dramatic landscape. The size of the panda is large enough to make it a focal point, but not so large it overwhelms the background.
