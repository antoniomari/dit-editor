Generate an image in a bold, stylized, Post-Impressionistic painting style reminiscent of early 20th-century art.  The scene depicts a simple, slightly elevated perspective of a table setting in a cafe or kitchen.

**Scene:** The table is covered with a green checkered tablecloth, with visible brushstrokes suggesting texture and depth.  On the table are:

* **A light blue teacup and saucer:** The teacup is filled with dark brown tea, and the saucer features a simple design.  The brushstrokes should be visible, giving a slightly rough texture.
* **A purple teapot:** A slightly bulbous teapot with a handle and spout, exhibiting visible brushstrokes and a slightly matte appearance.
* **A small, brown baked item:**  Possibly a muffin or small cake, sitting on a pink plate. The texture should appear slightly crumbly, contrasted with the smooth plate. A knife and fork are partially visible on the plate, resting next to the baked good.
* **A small, mustard-yellow mug:**  Partially visible, placed slightly behind and to the left of the teacup.


**Lighting:**  The lighting is soft and diffused, with no harsh shadows.  A slight highlight on the teapot and teacup suggests a light source from slightly above and in front.

**Background:** Two mismatched chairs are visible in the background, one light blue and one dark brown-gold.  They have a simple design and are depicted with visible, somewhat rough brushstrokes, consistent with the overall style. The wall behind the chairs appears textured and slightly gray.

**Composition:** The objects are arranged centrally on the table, with the teacup and saucer slightly off-center to the left. The teapot sits slightly behind and to the right of the teacup. The chairs in the background provide a sense of depth and context.  The overall composition should be balanced and inviting.

**Style:** The style should be bold and expressive.  Use visible, textured brushstrokes with clearly defined shapes and colors. The color palette is relatively muted, using blues, greens, browns, purples, and yellows.  The overall feeling should be slightly naive and charming, reflecting a casual moment of everyday life. The brushwork should have a slight coarseness to it.  Avoid sharp lines and strive for a slightly imperfect, hand-painted look.
