Generate an image in a bold, stylized, almost naive painting style reminiscent of folk art.  The scene depicts a simple tea setting on a checkered tablecloth.

**Scene:** The main focus is on a table setting featuring a light blue teacup and saucer filled with dark brown tea. Beside it sits a purple teapot with a slightly bulbous body and a curved spout.  A small, brown baked good, possibly a pudding or cake, sits on a vibrant pink saucer with a blue napkin or paper under it. A simple knife and fork are placed near the treat.  In the background, two chairs are partially visible: one painted bright blue and the other a warm, yellowish-brown. A small, mustard-yellow mug is partially visible behind the teacup.

**Lighting:** The lighting is relatively even, but there are subtle shadows suggesting a light source from above and slightly in front.  The shadows aren't harsh, but add depth without realism.

**Style:** The style should be heavily textured, resembling thick brushstrokes or impasto technique.  The colors are slightly muted but still vibrant, with distinct areas of color and less blending. The lines are not perfectly smooth; some slight roughness and imperfections are desirable.  The overall feel should be cheerful and slightly whimsical. The chairs in the background should have a more simplistic representation, blocky and less detailed than the tea set. The background suggests a room, but it is largely abstractâ€”a mix of grey and muted colors representing a wall, implied rather than clearly defined.

**Composition:** The tea set is centrally positioned, with the chairs slightly off-center in the background.  The tablecloth is a dominant feature, with its checkered pattern providing a visual rhythm. The arrangement is slightly asymmetrical but balanced.

**Specific Color Palette (approximate):**

*   Teacup: Light Blue
*   Tea: Dark Brown
*   Teapot: Purple
*   Baked Good: Brown
*   Saucers: Pink and Light Blue
*   Tablecloth: Green and White (checkered)
*   Chairs: Blue and Yellowish Brown
*   Mug: Mustard Yellow
*   Background: Muted Grays, Greens and Off-Whites

The overall aim is a composition that is both inviting and visually striking, prioritizing bold color choices and textured brushwork over photorealism.  The image should have a slightly nostalgic or quaint feel.
