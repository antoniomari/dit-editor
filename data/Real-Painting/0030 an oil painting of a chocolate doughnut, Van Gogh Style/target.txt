Generate an image in the style of a naive painting, reminiscent of children's artwork. The background depicts a simple scene: a green checkered tablecloth covering a table situated in front of two wooden chairs, one blue and one yellow-brown.  The chairs are rendered with broad strokes and simple shapes, suggesting a child-like understanding of perspective. The wall behind the table is a textured, mottled grey-blue.  The background style should be consistent throughout, maintaining a childlike simplicity and visible brushstrokes.

In the foreground, centrally placed on the tablecloth, is a chocolate-glazed donut adorned with small, round, light-orange candies arranged evenly around its circumference.  The donut is slightly glossy and realistically rendered in contrast to the naive style of the background. The donut sits on a pink and white patterned plate.  A pair of metallic utensils, seemingly forks, is partially visible beneath the donut on a light blue napkin or placemat.

To the left of the donut, slightly offset, is a setting of tea: a light blue teacup filled with brown tea, sitting on a light blue saucer.  The cup is small and has a handle.  Beside the tea setting, and slightly behind, is a small yellow-orange mug. To the right of the teacup, further back, sits a purple teapot with a round body and a short spout. The teapot and teacup cast a slight shadow on the tablecloth.  The objects' positions suggest a simple still-life arrangement.

The overall effect should blend the realistic portrayal of the donut with the painterly simplicity of the background, emphasizing the contrast between the meticulous detail of the food and the naive artistic style of the surrounding environment.  The lighting should be soft and diffused, as if the scene is lit by natural light. The colors should be slightly muted and slightly saturated to reflect a child-like color palette.
