Generate an image in a bold, stylized post-impressionistic style reminiscent of Van Gogh or Gauguin, emphasizing visible brushstrokes and a slightly textured surface.  The scene depicts a simple table setting outdoors or in a brightly lit room.

**Scene:** The main focus is a checkered, green tablecloth on a table.  On the table are the following items:

* **A light blue teacup and saucer:** The cup is filled with dark brown tea, and the saucer has a slightly mottled appearance, matching the texture of the tablecloth.
* **A purple teapot:**  A slightly squat teapot with a rounded body, its handle and spout are clearly defined.  It's positioned slightly behind and to the left of the teacup.
* **A small, brown baked good:** This is reminiscent of a pudding or small cake, sitting on a pink plate with a decorative border. A silver knife and fork lie on the plate next to the baked good.
* **A small, yellow mug:** This is placed partially off-camera in the background to the left, suggesting a second beverage.

**Background:** Two wooden chairs are partially visible in the background; one is blue and the other is a golden yellow-brown. The background beyond the chairs is painted in a blurred, textured style showing muted grey and white tones, suggestive of a wall or fence.

**Lighting:** The scene is brightly lit, with shadows subtly suggesting a light source from above and slightly to the left. The shadows are not harshly defined but soft and blended with the overall texture of the painting.

**Composition:** The composition is centered around the teacup and teapot, with the cake and chairs forming a balanced visual framing.  The green checkered tablecloth provides a strong underlying pattern that helps organize the visual elements.  The brushstrokes should be most prominent in the tablecloth and the background, giving a sense of movement and energy. The objects on the table should have somewhat more defined shapes, but still retain the brushstroke character of the painting.  The overall feeling should be cheerful and slightly whimsical.

**Style:**  The style should evoke a naive, slightly childlike perspective while maintaining a level of artistic skill and sophistication. Colors should be vibrant but slightly muted, consistent with a post-impressionistic palette.  The brushstrokes should be visible and expressive, contributing significantly to the texture and the overall effect.
