Generate an image in the style of a naive painting or child's drawing with visible brushstrokes.  The background depicts a table setting in a stylized manner.  The table is a grid of green, white, and light-green squares. Two chairs are positioned behind the table; one is light blue and the other is a brownish-orange. The chairs are rendered simply, with only the basic shape and visible slats. On the table is a purple teapot, a light orange mug, and a light blue teacup filled with brown tea. The objects have simple, rounded shapes with little detail. The entire background scene is somewhat blurry and out of focus.

The foreground element is a sandwich. Specifically, a sub or hoagie-style sandwich with visible meat and lettuce. It's positioned slightly off-center, on a pink and white patterned plate. The sandwich is slightly larger than the teacup and sits prominently in the lower-middle portion of the image. Cutlery, depicted by two simple lines suggesting a knife and fork, are partially visible under the sandwich on the plate. The sandwich is rendered with slightly more realistic detail compared to the painterly style of the background, making it stand out. The overall effect should be a whimsical and somewhat surreal juxtaposition of a simple tea setting and a realistically rendered sandwich.  The style should maintain a consistency across both the background and foreground, indicating they are part of the same artistic piece, but with the sandwich rendered with more attention to detail.
