Generate an image in the style of Vincent van Gogh, depicting a landscape under a dramatic, cloudy sky.

**Scene:** The scene should feature a flat, grassy field in the foreground, dotted with small, colorful wildflowers in shades of yellow, white, and orange.  Beyond the field, a line of low-lying trees, rendered with visible brushstrokes, forms a horizon.  Among these trees, several taller, more prominent trees with full, rounded crowns stand out, possibly willows or poplars, with touches of pink or reddish blossoms hinting at spring.  In the mid-ground, a simple, low rectangular building with a predominantly orange-red hue stands, suggesting a farmhouse or shed. The background is dominated by a large, expressive sky.

**Sky:** The sky is the most prominent feature, filled with large, swirling clouds.  These clouds should be rendered with thick, impasto brushstrokes in shades of grey, purple, blue, and white, conveying a sense of movement and impending weather. The clouds should have a slightly ethereal, almost turbulent quality. Some areas of lighter blue sky should peek through the clouds, creating contrast.

**Lighting:** The lighting should be diffused, suggestive of an overcast day, but not gloomy.  The light should be soft and slightly muted, not harsh or overly bright, reflecting the overall mood of the painting.  There should be a subtle suggestion of light filtering through the clouds.

**Style:** The style should be distinctly Post-Impressionistic, mimicking Van Gogh's signature thick, visible brushstrokes and impasto technique. The colors should be rich and vibrant, yet slightly desaturated to evoke a naturalistic, but emotional, feel.  The brushstrokes should be expressive, reflecting the movement of the clouds and the feeling of the wind.  The overall palette should be dominated by greens in the field, blues and greys in the sky, and muted orange-reds in the building.

**Composition:** The composition should be relatively horizontal, with the grassy field occupying about the lower third of the image and the sky taking up the upper two-thirds.  The trees along the horizon provide a visual break and lead the eye across the landscape. The prominent clouds should add a dynamic element to the otherwise tranquil landscape.  The overall feeling should be one of peaceful yet dramatic natural beauty.
