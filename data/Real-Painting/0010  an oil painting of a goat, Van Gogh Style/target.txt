Generate an image in the style of Vincent van Gogh's "Landscape with Trees and Clouds".  The background should be a vibrant, impasto landscape with characteristic swirling brushstrokes.  The sky should be dominated by large, expressive clouds in varying shades of blue, grey, and purple. The clouds should have a dynamic, almost turbulent quality.  The lower portion of the scene depicts a grassy field dotted with small, flowering bushes and trees painted with short, visible brushstrokes, utilizing a color palette consistent with Van Gogh's work (greens, yellows, hints of orange and blue). In the mid-ground, a row of stylized trees with visible brushstrokes are positioned, behind which a small orange-toned building is barely visible.  

In the foreground, place a single, white goat. The goat should be realistically rendered in contrast to the painterly style of the background, appearing slightly out of place but seamlessly blended into the field. Its placement should be approximately in the middle of the foreground meadow, slightly off-center. The goat should be facing left and appear calm and serene. It should be positioned so that it interacts with the background in a way that suggests it's peacefully grazing in the Van Gogh-style landscape. The overall scene should feel slightly surreal and whimsical due to the juxtaposition of the realistic goat with the impressionistic background. The addition of the goat slightly alters the mood of the base background, adding an element of gentle tranquility to the already evocative landscape. The resulting image should maintain the emotional intensity of van Goghâ€™s style, while introducing an unexpected, charming element.
