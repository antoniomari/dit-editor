Generate an image in a bold, stylized, almost naive painting style reminiscent of folk art. The scene depicts a simple table setting on a checkered green tablecloth.  

The main focus is a collection of items:

* **A teacup and saucer:** The teacup is light blue, filled with dark brown tea, and sits on a matching light blue saucer.  The style should be slightly imperfect, with visible brushstrokes and a slightly uneven finish.

* **A teapot:** A purple teapot, slightly more realistic than other elements, sits to the side of the teacup.  It's a classic shape but rendered with a slightly childlike simplification of form and shading.

* **A small cake or pudding:** A dark brown, almost burnt-looking, cake or pudding is placed on a bright pink plate. The cake has a simple, somewhat irregular shape. A sliver of a pale blue napkin or paper is partially visible underneath. A dark brown knife or spatula rests on the plate alongside the cake.


* **A small yellow mug:** A small, simple yellow mug sits in the background, slightly out of focus compared to the central elements.


The background features two chairs, partially visible, one a light blue and the other a mustard yellow.  These are rendered in a similar simple, blocky style, using broad brushstrokes and simplified details. The background wall is a muted grey-green with hints of texture, suggesting a rough wall or weathered wood.


The overall lighting is soft and diffused, with no harsh shadows, lending a calm and peaceful mood. The color palette is somewhat muted with pops of vibrant color (the pink plate, purple teapot, and blue teacup stand out). The entire scene should convey a sense of quiet simplicity and homely charm. The style should have a visible hand-painted look, with brush strokes clearly visible and not perfectly blended. The image should have a slightly uneven texture, mimicking the look of a painting done with acrylics or gouache.  The checkered tablecloth adds to the folksy feel.
