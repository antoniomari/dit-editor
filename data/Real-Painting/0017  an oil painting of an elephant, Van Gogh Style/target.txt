Generate an image in the style of Vincent van Gogh's "Almond Blossoms," but with a significant change.  The background should be a faithful recreation of the characteristic swirling clouds, expressive brushstrokes, and the distinct color palette of Van Gogh's painting, focusing on a landscape with several stylized, blossoming trees in the mid-ground. The colors should be vibrant, with blues, yellows, and greens predominating, and the brushstrokes should be clearly visible and impasto-like.

In the foreground, place a single Asian elephant. The elephant should be positioned slightly off-center, facing towards the right of the frame. It should appear realistically rendered in comparison to the painterly background; its skin texture should be detailed and contrasted against the less realistic, more expressive background.  The elephant should appear calm and somewhat subdued, perhaps grazing or simply standing, not interacting dramatically with the background. The elephant's size should be such that it occupies a significant portion of the lower third of the image without overpowering the overall aesthetic.

The integration between the realistic elephant and the painterly background should be seamless but noticeable. The lighting should be consistent, maintaining a soft, natural light across both the elephant and the background landscape.  The overall effect should create a surreal and unexpected juxtaposition between the realistic depiction of the animal and the highly expressive, artistic style of the background.  The scene should feel peaceful despite the contrast in styles.
