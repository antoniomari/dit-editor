Generate an image in the style of Vincent van Gogh, specifically reminiscent of his later works. The scene depicts a pastoral landscape under a dramatic, cloudy sky.

**Sky:** The sky dominates the upper two-thirds of the image, filled with large, swirling clouds rendered in shades of pale lavender, deep violet, and hints of light yellow-white.  The clouds are not realistically depicted but rather expressed through thick, impasto brushstrokes, conveying a sense of movement and turbulence. Some areas suggest a subtle rain shower.  The sky should have a sense of depth and luminosity.

**Foreground:** The foreground is a vibrant green field speckled with tiny, colorful flowers, depicted with short, dabs of paint in various yellows, whites, and oranges.  The grass itself is rendered with visible, textured brushstrokes in various shades of green.


**Midground:**  A dark green line representing a thin hedge or ditch separates the foreground field from a midground featuring a row of flowering trees. These are rendered with visible brushstrokes, primarily in green, with touches of pink and white to indicate blossoms.  Behind these trees, a small, rectangular orange and blue building is visible, depicted with bolder, more defined brushstrokes than the surrounding landscape. A line of darker green trees appears beyond the building, indicating further distance.


**Overall Composition:** The composition should be somewhat horizontal, with the sky taking up a significant portion. The trees in the midground should be positioned to provide visual rhythm and balance.  The use of color and brushstrokes should evoke a feeling of both tranquility and dramatic movement. The lighting should be soft, diffused light with some darker shadows within the clouds and under the trees.

**Style:** The overall style should be highly impressionistic and expressive, characteristic of van Gogh's late style. Visible, impasto brushstrokes are crucial, conveying texture and emotion.  Color should be bold and vibrant yet somewhat muted in overall tone, with a slightly melancholic feel.  The image should avoid sharp lines; all edges should be soft and blended.
