Generate an image in the style of a loose, impressionistic oil painting.  The subject is a cityscape, reminiscent of the New York City skyline, viewed from across a body of water.

**Scene:** The main focus is a row of stylized skyscrapers, varying in height and color.  One prominent, tall, slender building (One World Trade Center) stands slightly taller than the others, acting as a visual anchor.  The buildings should have a slightly cubist feel, with visible brushstrokes implying texture and depth rather than precise architectural details.  The colors should be somewhat muted pastels with pops of brighter colors, specifically reds, oranges and pinks in various buildings.  The buildings should have an impressionistic, not realistic style.  The foreground is a calm body of water, reflecting the city's muted colors in a slightly blurred, impressionistic way. A few small boats are subtly visible on the water.  A thin line of greenery, suggested rather than detailed, separates the city from the water.

**Lighting:** The lighting is soft and diffused, suggesting an overcast day or soft morning/evening light.  There are no harsh shadows; the overall mood is serene and peaceful. The sky is a pale, light blue, almost white, with subtle variations in tone suggesting a hazy atmosphere.

**Style:** The painting should emulate the style of a loose, expressive oil painting with visible brushstrokes. The colors should be blended somewhat but also show distinct brushwork, giving a sense of movement and texture. Edges of buildings should be softly defined, not sharp. The overall effect should be painterly and evocative, not photorealistic.

**Composition:** The city skyline is centrally positioned, spanning almost the entire width of the canvas. The calm water in the foreground provides a strong horizontal element, balancing the verticality of the buildings. The color palette is generally cool and calming, with the warmer pops of color adding visual interest within the cityscape without overwhelming the peaceful mood. The view is from a slightly elevated perspective, looking across the water at the city.
