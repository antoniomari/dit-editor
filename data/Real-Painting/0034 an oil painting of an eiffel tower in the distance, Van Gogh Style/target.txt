Generate an image of a stylized cityscape reminiscent of an impressionist painting. The background is a cityscape, with buildings of varying heights and pastel colors, primarily blues, pinks, and muted oranges.  The buildings are not precisely rendered but have a painterly, blocky quality, suggesting a sense of depth and urban density but without sharp lines or photorealism. The water in the foreground is a calm, reflective blue-grey, mirroring the cityscape. The sky is a pale, hazy blue.

The foreground element is a dark teal silhouette of the Eiffel Tower, positioned centrally within the cityscape's skyline.  It's slightly larger than the surrounding buildings, but maintains the same painterly style, blending with the overall impressionistic aesthetic instead of appearing jarringly imposed. It is not perfectly sharp, sharing the textured brushstroke quality of the background buildings, suggesting it is a part of the scene rather than simply superimposed.  The Eiffel Tower's placement is such that its base rests on the waterfront, with its peak reaching slightly above the tallest buildings in the background cityscape.  The overall effect is a surreal juxtaposition of two iconic cityscapes, blended seamlessly to create a unified, dreamlike urban landscape.  The interaction between the foreground and background is harmonious; there are no harsh contrasts in style or color, resulting in an artistic merging of architectural icons.
