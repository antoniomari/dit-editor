Generate an image in the style of Vincent van Gogh, specifically reminiscent of his landscape paintings.  The scene is a pastoral landscape featuring a flat, grassy field in the foreground, speckled with small, scattered wildflowers in various shades of yellow, white, and orange. The grass itself is a vibrant green, painted with visible, impasto brushstrokes.

The middle ground displays a line of low-lying, lush green trees and shrubs, punctuated by several taller, more prominent trees with light-pinkish blossoms near their tops. These trees are rendered with thick, expressive brushwork, creating a sense of movement and vitality. Behind these trees, sits a simple, rectangular building, painted in shades of dark blue and orange-brown.

The background is dominated by a dramatic, swirling sky.  The clouds are voluminous and dynamic, painted with thick, expressive brushstrokes in shades of light and dark grey, purple, and blue.  These brushstrokes are visibly textured, with lighter areas suggesting the presence of light filtering through the clouds. The sky is a lighter blue in the spaces between the clouds.  

The overall lighting is soft and diffuse, suggesting an overcast day, but with patches of light breaking through the clouds. The colors are vibrant but somewhat muted, characteristic of Van Gogh's palette, with an emphasis on blues, greens, and purples. The composition uses a horizontal format, with the horizon line roughly one-third up from the bottom of the image.  The focus should be on the emotional impact of the scene; the energy of the sky and the serene tranquility of the field should be balanced, creating a feeling of both calm and dynamic movement.  The style should emphasize visible brushstrokes throughout, mimicking the texture of oil paint.  The overall image should feel both realistic and expressive, conveying the artist's emotional response to the scene.
