Generate an image of a large sulcata tortoise positioned in the lower-center of a field.  The tortoise should be facing the viewer, its head slightly lowered.  Its shell should be light brown, with subtle textural details visible.  The tortoise's skin should appear dry and slightly rough.

The field is bright green with sparsely scattered small, white, and yellow flowers. This field sits in front of a background painting in the style of Van Gogh. The painting should feature a vibrant blue sky filled with thick, swirling clouds rendered with visible brushstrokes.  The clouds are primarily shades of grey, purple and white, with visible texture and impasto style. Beneath the clouds, a flat green landscape is shown with small, stylized trees, painted in a similar impasto style as the clouds.  The trees appear to be mostly in shades of green and brown. There is a small, indistinct orange-brown building visible in the far distance within the painting.

The Van Gogh-style background should cover the entire area behind the tortoise, extending to the edges of the image, making it clear the tortoise is a foreground element added to a pre-existing artwork.  The lighting in the image should be consistent throughout, with soft natural daylight illuminating both the tortoise and the painting. The overall effect should be whimsical and slightly surreal, juxtaposing the realism of the tortoise with the stylized painting behind it. The style of the image should be photorealistic, except for the background, which should match the style of Vincent Van Gogh's paintings.
