Generate an image in the style of Vincent van Gogh, specifically emulating his expressive brushstrokes and color palette.  The scene depicts a pastoral landscape under a dramatic sky.

**Sky:** The sky dominates the upper two-thirds of the image. It’s filled with large, swirling clouds rendered in shades of light and dark blue, purple, and gray. The clouds are not realistically depicted but are instead formed with visible, impasto brushstrokes, suggesting movement and a potentially stormy atmosphere.  Some areas of the sky peek through the clouds showing a lighter blue. The brushstrokes should be thick and energetic, with variations in texture and direction to convey the feeling of wind and movement.

**Foreground:** The foreground is a field of vibrant green grass, dotted with small, colorful wildflowers in yellow, white, and orange.  The grass is painted with short, textured brushstrokes, giving it a slightly uneven and lively appearance.  The wildflowers are scattered organically across the field, not in a uniform pattern.

**Midground:** A dark green line represents a low fence or border separating the field from the next area. Beyond this line are several flowering trees, primarily in shades of green and muted pink/red blossoms, painted with individual, visible brushstrokes, showing texture and depth. These trees are spaced apart, and their shapes are somewhat irregular and stylized, not perfectly symmetrical.  In the background behind the trees, a simple rectangular building – perhaps a house or barn – is visible in shades of orange and blue, appearing more as a suggestion than a detailed structure.


**Overall Composition:** The composition is relatively horizontal, with the sky dominating the upper portion and the field filling the lower portion. The trees in the midground act as a visual anchor, separating the sky and the foreground. The use of color is crucial: vibrant greens and blues against the purples and grays of the sky create a dynamic contrast.  The entire image should be imbued with a sense of energy and emotion, characteristic of van Gogh's style. The brushstrokes should be visible and expressive throughout the painting, contributing to its texture and artistic feel. The overall effect should be a highly expressive and somewhat impressionistic rendering of a rural landscape.
