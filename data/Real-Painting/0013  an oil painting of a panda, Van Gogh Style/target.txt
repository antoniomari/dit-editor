Generate an image in the style of Vincent van Gogh's "The Orchard," but with a foreground element added.  The background should be a clear representation of his style:  thick, impasto brushstrokes, vibrant blues and greens in the sky, and swirling clouds rendered in shades of purple, blue and grey-white.  The sky should take up about two-thirds of the image.  The lower third should show a field of short green grass with small, scattered flowers rendered in a similar painterly style.  Several stylized trees, with a visible trunk and slightly darker, almost black, clumps of leaves should be positioned in the mid-ground. A small, orange-ish brown building is slightly visible behind the trees in the middle ground.


In the foreground, place a single giant panda. The panda should be positioned slightly off-center, towards the left of the frame, sitting down in the grassy field. It should be rendered realistically, in stark contrast to the Van Gogh style of the background.  The panda should appear slightly furry, with its black and white markings clearly defined. The panda should have a slightly slumped posture, conveying a sense of calm.


The interaction between the foreground and background should be simple juxtaposition: The realistically rendered panda sits in the Van Gogh landscape without altering or interacting with the paint strokes themselves. The lighting on the panda should be consistent with the lighting of the scene;  it is a daytime scene with bright, but slightly muted light.  The overall effect should be a humorous and surreal juxtaposition of styles.
