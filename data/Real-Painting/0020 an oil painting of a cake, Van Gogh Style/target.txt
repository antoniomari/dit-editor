Generate an image of a stylized still life depicting a tea setting.  The background should be a painting in a naive or folk art style, featuring a green checkered tablecloth on a table. Two chairs, one blue and one brown-orange, are visible in the background, partially obscured by the foreground elements. The chairs should be simple in design, with visible slats. The background painting should have a slightly textured appearance, reminiscent of acrylic paint strokes on canvas, with visible brushwork and varied color saturation.

The foreground elements are superimposed onto this background, appearing as if they are actually present on the table.  These elements include:

* **A cup and saucer:** A light blue teacup, filled with dark brown tea, rests on a matching light blue saucer. The cup and saucer have a slightly glossy appearance.  Place them to the left of center, slightly overlapping the tablecloth's pattern.

* **A teapot:** A purple teapot, with a rounded body and a slightly curved spout and handle, sits to the right of the cup and saucer and slightly behind it.  It appears to be made of ceramic.

* **A small cake:** A light green, round cake, decorated with a white, stylized floral or arabesque pattern on top, rests on a pink and white patterned plate. This plate is placed to the lower right of the scene, somewhat overlapping the tablecloth.  The cake itself should have a slightly textured surface, possibly suggesting frosting. The cake should appear slightly out of proportion to the other objects, adding a touch of whimsicality.

* **A yellow mug:** A small, yellow mug is visible in the upper left, partially obscured by the cup and saucer.  It appears to be empty.

The foreground elements should have a slightly different texture and level of detail than the background painting, making them stand out while still maintaining visual cohesion. The lighting should be soft and even across the scene, creating a calm and inviting atmosphere.  The overall style should be whimsical and slightly surreal, with the added cake being the main focus of the surreal element.  The style is a mix of naive painting and photorealistic rendering of the objects.
