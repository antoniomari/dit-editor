Generate an image in a stylized, slightly naive painting style reminiscent of children's book illustrations or folk art.  The overall palette should be vibrant but slightly muted, with a focus on greens, blues, and purples.

The scene depicts a tabletop setting, featuring:

* **Tabletop:** A green checkered tablecloth with visible brushstrokes suggesting a slightly textured surface.  The check pattern should be loose and irregular, not perfectly aligned.

* **Tea Set:** A light blue teacup and saucer filled with dark brown tea. The teacup has a simple, rounded design.  Next to it is a purple teapot with a slightly bulbous body and a curved spout. The teapot should be rendered with visible brushstrokes that show the texture of the paint.

* **Food:** A dark brown baked good (similar to a small cake or pudding) on a bright pink plate.  The plate has an irregular, hand-painted appearance. A knife and fork are partially visible next to it, lying on a light blue napkin or paper.

* **Background:** Two mismatched chairs are visible in the background; one is blue and the other is a yellowish brown. The chairs are simply rendered, with only the basic framework indicated. A muted grayish-brown wall or background is visible behind the chairs, with hints of shading suggesting depth, but done in a loose painterly fashion.

* **Lighting:** The lighting should be soft and diffused, with no harsh shadows. The light appears to be coming from above, subtly highlighting the surfaces of the objects.

* **Style:** The overall style should be expressive and slightly imperfect, with visible brushstrokes and a lack of perfect realism.  The colors should be slightly blended, but with clear color boundaries, giving a sense of flatness while still conveying three-dimensionality.  Think of the style as somewhere between folk art and post-impressionism, with a slightly childlike quality to the execution.

The composition should be fairly balanced, with the tea set as the central focus, but with the chairs and background elements adding to the overall scene. The image should feel peaceful and inviting, like a scene from a cozy moment.  The style and brushstrokes should make it clear that this is a painting, not a photorealistic image.
