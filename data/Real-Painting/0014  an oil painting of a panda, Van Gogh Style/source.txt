Generate an image in the style of Vincent van Gogh, specifically reminiscent of his landscapes.  The scene depicts a flat, expansive field of vibrant green grass speckled with small, colorful wildflowers, predominantly yellows and whites.  The field occupies the lower third of the image.

Beyond the field, a dark green hedge or low wall separates it from a row of willow-like trees. These trees are rendered with visible brushstrokes, showing a mix of light and dark greens, some with hints of yellow-green.  Several of these trees stand prominently, taller than the rest, with their branches depicted in a slightly stylized, almost flame-like fashion.  A small, rectangular building—a muted orange-red with hints of blue—is visible behind the trees, partially obscured.  More trees, darker and more densely packed, extend beyond the building, to the horizon.

The sky dominates the upper two-thirds of the composition. It's filled with dramatic, swirling clouds rendered in shades of pale blues, light lavenders, and deep purples. The clouds are not realistically depicted but instead, expressed through thick, impasto brushstrokes that convey a sense of movement and energy.  These strokes are swirling, almost chaotic, with varying thicknesses and directions, suggesting a windy day perhaps before or after a rain shower.  There's a subtle suggestion of light rain in some areas of the sky with faint vertical streaks.

The overall lighting is slightly diffuse, suggesting an overcast day, but the colors remain bright and intensely saturated.  The palette is characteristic of van Gogh’s work, with bold, contrasting colors and visible brushstrokes forming the primary compositional element. The image should have a slightly textured, almost rough appearance, typical of oil on canvas. The perspective is fairly flat, with a low horizon line emphasizing the expanse of the field.
