Generate an image in the style of Vincent van Gogh.  The background should be a landscape reminiscent of his work, featuring a vibrant blue sky filled with thick, swirling, impasto clouds in shades of purple, gray, and light blue.  The clouds should be dynamic and expressive, with visible brushstrokes.  Below the clouds, depict a flat, grassy field dotted with small, stylized trees with dark, expressive trunks and rounded crowns of light green.  These trees should be rendered with visible brushstrokes, mimicking Van Gogh's technique.  In the mid-ground, include a few simple structures or buildings, painted in a bold, blocky manner using earthy orange and dark blue colors. The field should show small wildflowers scattered across the grass, rendered with short, dabs of various light and bright colors.


In the foreground of this Van Gogh-esque landscape, place a giant panda lying on its side in the field, resting comfortably. The panda should be realistically rendered, with a smooth, detailed fur texture contrasting with the impressionistic style of the background.  Its placement should be central, slightly off-center, causing a slight disruption to the visual flow of the background's field but creating a juxtaposition between the realistic animal and the stylized landscape.  The panda's coloring should be accurate, showcasing its black and white fur.  There should be a sense of peaceful interaction between the sleepy animal and the vibrant, active background, with no visible blending or integration of the panda's textures into the painted field. The overall effect should be a surreal and charming combination of realism and impressionism.
