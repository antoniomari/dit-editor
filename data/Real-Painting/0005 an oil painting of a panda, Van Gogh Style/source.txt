Generate an image in the style of Vincent van Gogh, specifically evoking his impasto technique and characteristic brushstrokes.  The scene depicts a pastoral landscape under a dramatic sky.

**Sky:** The sky dominates the upper two-thirds of the image, filled with swirling, turbulent clouds rendered in shades of pale lavender, deep purple, and muted blues.  The clouds are not realistically shaped; instead, they are depicted with thick, visible brushstrokes that create a sense of movement and energy.  There's a suggestion of light breaking through the clouds in patches of lighter blue.  The brushstrokes should be dynamic and expressive, conveying a feeling of wind and impending change.


**Foreground:** The foreground is a field of vibrant green grass speckled with small, colorful flowers in white, yellow, and orange hues. The brushstrokes here should be shorter and more textured, suggesting the varied height and density of the flowers.  The grass itself is not uniformly colored but displays subtle variations in tone.


**Midground:** A dark green strip represents a narrow line separating the field from a row of trees and a building.  The trees are depicted with short, thick brushstrokes, suggesting fullness and texture. They are primarily in shades of green, with hints of yellow and brown.  Behind the trees, a simple rectangular building, predominantly orange-red with a suggestion of blue detailing, can be seen. This structure is not highly detailed; focus instead on the impactful color and brushwork.


**Composition:** The composition is fairly horizontal, with the sky taking up a larger portion. The trees and building in the midground create a clear horizontal line across the middle. The colors are generally cool in the sky and warm in the foreground, creating a visual contrast.  The overall composition should feel balanced but energetic, reflecting the dynamism of the sky.


**Style and Technique:**  The style should mimic Van Goghâ€™s impasto technique; the paint should appear thick and textured, with the brushstrokes being highly visible and expressive.  The colors should be bold and slightly exaggerated, not photorealistic.  Use a palette knife to mimic that thick paint application if possible. The use of color should be evocative and suggestive, rather than precise.

The overall mood should be one of dramatic beauty and emotional intensity, typical of Van Gogh's work. The image should convey a sense of movement and impending weather change.
