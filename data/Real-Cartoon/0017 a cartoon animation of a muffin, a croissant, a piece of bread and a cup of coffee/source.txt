Generate a cartoon-style image of a breakfast scene set on a red and white checkered tablecloth.Â 


The scene includes:

* **Food:** Two fried eggs with sunny-side up yolks on a white plate. A croissant, slightly browned and buttery-looking, is positioned next to the plate. A wedge of cheese, light yellow with darker yellow markings indicating texture, sits to the side. A small garnish of red cherry tomatoes and green parsley is on the plate next to the eggs.

* **Drink:** A steaming cup of coffee in a simple white mug. The steam should be stylized and clearly visible.

* **Table setting:**  A simple white plate for the eggs, and a white saucer underneath the coffee cup.

* **Tablecloth:** A classic red and white checkered tablecloth provides the background.

* **Lighting:** The lighting should be soft and even, slightly brighter on the food items to make them pop, with a soft, pastel background light that suggests a sunny morning.

* **Style:** The style should be bright, clean, and cheerful, evocative of a children's illustration or a simple, friendly breakfast advertisement.  Think slightly glossy textures on the food for visual appeal.  The edges of the objects should be smooth and not sharply defined. The overall feel should be simple and inviting.

* **Composition:**  The food items should be arranged appealingly but naturally, not overly symmetrical. The coffee cup is slightly off-center, adding to a casual feel.  The background should be simple and uncluttered, allowing the food to be the focus. The whole scene should be contained within a square or slightly rectangular frame.
