Generate an image of a red and white checkered tablecloth.  On the tablecloth, arrange the following items:

* **Foreground Elements:**

    * A chocolate cupcake with a swirl of light brown frosting topped with chocolate sprinkles. The cupcake sits on a small white plate next to a few small red berries and a sprig of green. Place the plate slightly off-center, towards the left.  The cupcake should be detailed, showing texture in both the frosting and cake.

    * A croissant, light golden brown in color, positioned slightly below and to the right of the cupcake. It should look freshly baked and slightly curved.


    * A wedge of yellow cheese, positioned slightly behind and to the right of the croissant. It should be realistically rendered, showing the texture and holes in the cheese. The cheese should appear slightly warm, hinting at a soft, pliable texture.


    * A white coffee mug filled with dark brown coffee, with a small plume of steam rising from it. The mug is on a white saucer, placed to the right of the cheese and slightly behind it. The coffee should appear hot and inviting.  Make sure the mug shows some subtle reflections of light.

* **Background:**

   The background is a simple, light blue sky, visible only above the checkered tablecloth.  The tablecloth takes up most of the frame.  The overall lighting should be bright and soft, suitable for a breakfast or brunch scene.

* **Interaction:**

The items are arranged naturally, as if someone has set out a small breakfast or snack.  There is no obvious overlap or interaction between the items, other than their placement on the tablecloth.

* **Overall Scene Changes:**

Compared to a simple image of just a checkered tablecloth, the added food elements transform it into a cozy and inviting breakfast or snack scene. The addition of the food creates a sense of warmth and deliciousness.  Make the color palette of the entire scene vibrant but realistic. The overall style should be cartoonish, yet detailed and appealing.
