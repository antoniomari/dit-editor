Generate an image of a forest clearing, rendered in a cartoon style.  The scene should be daytime with soft, diffused lighting; think of a sunny day lightly filtered through a dense canopy. Avoid harsh shadows.

The clearing is dominated by a large, gently undulating patch of pale tan sand or light-colored earth that occupies the foreground and lower middle ground.  Sparse tufts of bright green grass are scattered across this sandy area.

The background features a dense forest.  The trees are primarily tall, thick-trunked, dark brown trees with rounded, full green canopies.  The leaves should have a slightly glossy appearance.  There's a variety of greens in the undergrowth, including smaller bushes and plants, including some slightly reddish-brown foliage, suggesting a diversity of flora.  The trees should create a sense of depth, with some slightly blurred in the background, indicating distance.  The overall color palette is vibrant but natural; avoid overly saturated or artificial colors.

The style should be reminiscent of children's book illustrations or animation â€“ simple shapes, smooth gradients, and a focus on clarity and readability. The composition should be balanced, with the clearing acting as a visual anchor and inviting the viewer's eye into the scene.  The perspective is slightly elevated, looking slightly down on the clearing. There should be a suggestion of a tranquil, peaceful forest environment.
