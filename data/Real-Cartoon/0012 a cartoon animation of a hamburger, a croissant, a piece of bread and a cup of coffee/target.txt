Generate an image of a red and white checkered picnic blanket.  On the blanket are the following items:

* **Foreground Element 1: A cheeseburger:** A juicy hamburger with a sesame seed bun, lettuce, tomato, and a patty.  It's placed slightly off-center to the left, on a simple white plate. A small garnish of what appears to be parsley and three small red cherry tomatoes sits on the plate next to the burger.

* **Foreground Element 2: A croissant:** A golden-brown croissant is positioned to the right of the plate, slightly overlapping the bottom right corner of the plate.  It looks freshly baked and slightly curved.

* **Foreground Element 3: A wedge of cheese:**  A large triangular slice of yellow cheese sits in the middle-right of the scene. It has visible holes and a slightly cartoonish appearance. A small plume of steam rises from the top right corner suggesting it is warm.

* **Foreground Element 4: A cup of coffee:** A white coffee mug filled with dark brown coffee is positioned slightly to the right of the cheese.  A wisp of steam rises from the coffee.  It sits on a simple white saucer.

The background is a simple, lightly colored scene suggesting an outdoor setting, possibly a light blue sky or a pale wall. The focus is heavily on the food items arranged on the checkered blanket, making them the clear center of attention.  The lighting is even and bright, highlighting the textures of the food. The overall style should be cheerful and appetizing, suitable for a food-related illustration or advertisement.  The composite image should look seamless, as if all the elements were naturally part of the scene.
