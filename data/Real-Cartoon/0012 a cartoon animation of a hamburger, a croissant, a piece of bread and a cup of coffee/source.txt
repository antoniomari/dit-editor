Generate a cartoon-style image of a breakfast scene on a red and white checkered tablecloth.Â 


**Scene:** The main focus is a plate of two fried eggs sunny-side up, a croissant, a slice of cheese, and a cup of coffee steaming gently.  Three small, red cherry tomatoes and a sprig of parsley are artfully placed beside the eggs.


**Lighting:**  The lighting should be bright and cheerful, mimicking natural daylight, casting soft shadows to give the food a three-dimensional feel but without harsh contrasts.  The scene should be well-lit, implying a sunny morning.


**Style:** The style should be bright, clean, and simple, reminiscent of children's book illustrations or a friendly, cartoonish breakfast advertisement.  Lines should be smooth, and colors should be slightly saturated, but not overly vibrant.  The overall aesthetic should be inviting and appetizing.


**Composition:** Arrange the elements on the tablecloth to create a visually appealing composition. The plate of eggs should be slightly off-center, the croissant and cheese diagonally placed, and the coffee cup with its saucer below and slightly to the right of the main plate.  The composition should feel natural, as if someone has just set the breakfast table. The tablecloth should extend to all edges of the image and be slightly out of focus in the background to ensure the breakfast components remain the focus. The background above the table should be a light, slightly hazy blue, suggesting an open sky.
