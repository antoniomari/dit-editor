Generate a vibrant, cartoon-style illustration of a park scene nestled between modern city buildings under a bright blue sky.

**Scene:** The foreground features a sandy path winding through a lush green park.  A simple wooden park bench sits centrally on the sandy area near a gently curving blue river or stream.  On either side of the path are vibrant green bushes and trees. Some trees display autumnal colors, showcasing yellows, oranges, and reds, particularly towards the right of the image.  In the background, several modern, light-blue-toned skyscrapers rise, indicating a city setting.  The style should evoke a cheerful, family-friendly atmosphere.

**Lighting:** The scene is bathed in bright, cheerful sunlight, suggesting itâ€™s daytime.  The light is soft and even, without harsh shadows, contributing to the overall playful mood.

**Style:** The overall style should be similar to that of a children's book illustration, using clean lines, bold colors, and a slightly simplistic yet detailed approach to rendering the various elements. The trees and bushes should have a somewhat cartoonish, exaggerated appearance.  The color palette should be warm and inviting.

**Composition:**  The composition should be balanced, with the park acting as the central focus, bordered by the city buildings in the background and the lively vegetation in the foreground.  The path guides the viewer's eye from the foreground towards the city skyline.  Several ornate black lampposts, evenly spaced, line the path, adding to the park's charm and providing visual interest. The river is gently flowing, following the curve of the path.

Specifically, the autumnal trees should have leaves that are not photorealistic, but stylized for cartoon simplicity, with distinct shapes and colors.  The city buildings should have a flat, illustrative appearance, not meant to depict realism, but rather a child-like representation of city architecture.  The overall feel should be happy and inviting, suggesting a pleasant urban oasis.
