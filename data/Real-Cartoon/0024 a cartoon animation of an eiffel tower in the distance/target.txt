Generate an image of a park scene reminiscent of a stylized cartoon, with autumnal coloring.  The background should feature a cityscape with several tall, light teal-colored modern buildings, and the Eiffel Tower prominently situated behind them in the middle ground. The sky is a vibrant blue with fluffy white clouds.

The foreground will include:

* **A wooden park bench:**  A simple, light brown wooden bench positioned slightly off-center, near the bottom third of the image, facing towards the Eiffel Tower and cityscape. The bench is light brown with visible wood grain.

* **Two lampposts:** A pair of ornate black lampposts flank the bench, extending from the sandy-colored ground, slightly arched upwards.  These should be detailed enough to show distinct lamp shapes and posts.

* **Autumnal foliage:** Lush, autumn-colored trees and bushes frame the scene, with shades of orange, yellow, and red leaves.  The foliage should look slightly stylized, not photorealistic, and add to the cartoon feel.  The leaves should overlap parts of the path.

* **A winding path:** A light tan path snakes from the foreground toward the cityscape. It curves gently around the bench and lampposts, suggesting a leisurely stroll through the park.

* **A small river/stream:** A narrow, stylized river or stream should run near the base of the foliage on the left of the bench and path, visible beneath some foliage.  The water should be light blue, calm, and cartoonish in its depiction.

The overall style should be bright, cheerful, and slightly whimsical, like a children's book illustration or a mobile game background.  The interaction is that the bench and lampposts are placed within the park setting, with the path leading towards the Eiffel Tower and buildings in the background. The fall foliage adds depth and color. The scene must be a composite, not created naturally.  The overall feel should maintain consistency in the cartoon style across both foreground and background elements.
