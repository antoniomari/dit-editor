Generate a cartoon-style image of a forest clearing.  The style should be reminiscent of children's book illustrations, with smooth, slightly rounded edges and vibrant, non-photorealistic colors.

The scene should depict a sun-drenched clearing in a dense forest.  The clearing is centrally located and occupies about a third of the image, taking the form of a gently undulating patch of pale, sandy-yellow earth. Sparse tufts of bright green grass are scattered across this sandy area.

Surrounding the clearing is a lush forest.  The trees are predominantly large, thick-trunked with dark brown bark, and have full, rounded canopies of various shades of green.  The leaves should have a somewhat cartoonish, non-detailed look.  Some undergrowth is visible, consisting of smaller shrubs and bushes in varying shades of green and hints of red and yellow.

The lighting is soft and diffused, suggesting an overcast day or soft sunlight filtering through the canopy. The overall palette should be bright and cheerful, with warm tones predominating. There should be a gentle, subtle gradient of lighter tones in the background, suggesting depth and distance within the forest.

The composition should be balanced, with the clearing acting as a focal point, drawing the viewer's eye to the center. The trees should be arranged to create a sense of enclosure, framing the clearing without being overly crowded. The overall feel should be one of peaceful tranquility and gentle adventure.
