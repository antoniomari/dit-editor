Generate an image of a cartoon forest scene.  The background should be a stylized cartoon forest clearing.  The trees are tall and slender with dark brown trunks and full, rounded green canopies.  The undergrowth is lush and green with patches of yellow and red flowers.  The ground is a sandy tan color, slightly uneven, suggesting a gently sloping path or clearing.


In the foreground, centered in the lower portion of the image, place a realistic-looking grey squirrel. The squirrel should be sitting on the sandy ground, facing slightly to the right, with its body angled somewhat towards the viewer.  Its fur should be detailed, with variations in shading to show texture and depth. The squirrel appears to be grooming itself or holding something small near its face.  The squirrel should be positioned naturally within the scene, as if it belongs in this environment, rather than appearing as a pasted-on element.


The overall lighting should be soft and diffused, appropriate for a forest scene on a sunny day. The style should blend the cartoonish nature of the background with the slightly more realistic portrayal of the squirrel. The squirrel should not have any cartoonish outlines. The contrast between the more realistic squirrel and the cartoonish background should be apparent but not jarring. The composite image should have a slightly whimsical feel.
