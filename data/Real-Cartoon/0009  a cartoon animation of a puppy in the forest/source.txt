Generate an image of a cartoon-style forest clearing.  The style should be reminiscent of children's book illustrations, with bright, slightly muted colors and smooth outlines.

The scene depicts a sandy or light-brown clearing in the center, taking up roughly the lower half of the image. This clearing is uneven, with gently rolling mounds and a few sparsely scattered tufts of green grass.

The upper half is filled with a dense forest.  The trees are primarily large, thick-trunked trees with dark brown bark and full, rounded canopies of various shades of green.  There is a mix of tree heights and sizes to create depth. The leaves are simplified, without individual leaf detail.  Undergrowth is visible around the bases of the trees, consisting of smaller, simpler shrubs and bushes in various greens, with touches of reddish-brown for added visual interest.

The lighting is soft and diffused, suggesting an overcast day or gentle sunlight filtering through the canopy. There are no harsh shadows. The overall color palette is predominantly greens and browns, with pops of muted reds and yellows in the undergrowth.

The composition is straightforward, with the clearing acting as a focal point leading the eye into the scene. The trees frame the clearing, creating a sense of enclosure. The overall impression should be peaceful and inviting, suitable for a children's storybook setting.
