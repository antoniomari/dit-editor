Generate an image of a forest clearing, styled as a cartoon illustration for children's books.

**Scene:** The central focus is a gently undulating patch of pale, sandy-tan earth, occupying the lower half of the image.  Sparse tufts of bright green grass are scattered across the clearing.  Surrounding the clearing is a dense forest of tall, sturdy trees with thick, dark brown trunks. The trees are primarily shades of green, with variations in hue and saturation to suggest depth and foliage.  Undergrowth of smaller bushes and plants in varying shades of green, yellow, and reddish-brown fills the spaces between the larger trees at the edge of the clearing.


**Lighting:** The lighting is soft and diffused, suggesting an overcast day or dappled sunlight filtering through the dense canopy. There are no harsh shadows; the overall illumination is even and bright.


**Style:** The style should be reminiscent of classic children's book illustrations â€“ simple shapes, smooth shading with minimal detail on the trees and leaves, bold outlines, and a generally bright and cheerful color palette. The overall feel should be friendly and inviting, not overly detailed or realistic.


**Composition:** The clearing is centrally positioned, creating a natural focal point.  The trees are arranged around the clearing in a slightly irregular manner, suggesting a natural, unkempt forest setting.  The perspective is slightly elevated, looking down upon the clearing from a gentle angle.  The overall composition should be balanced and visually appealing, leading the eye naturally across the scene.  The image should be square or near-square in aspect ratio.
