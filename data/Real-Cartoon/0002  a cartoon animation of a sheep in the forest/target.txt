Generate an image of a cartoon-style forest clearing with a single sheep in the foreground.

**Background:**  The background should be a whimsical illustration of a forest clearing.  The style should be reminiscent of children's storybook illustrations.  It will feature a sandy, tan-colored clearing in the center, surrounded by a ring of lush green grass.  Behind the grass are a collection of cartoon trees with thick, brown trunks and full, rounded green canopies.  The trees should vary slightly in height and spacing to create a natural-looking forest edge.  Smaller bushes and tufts of grass should be scattered throughout the scene. The overall color palette should be bright and cheerful, with deep greens for the foliage and a light, sandy beige for the clearing. The lighting should be even and diffuse, suggesting a sunny day.

**Foreground:** In the center of the sandy clearing, place a single, fluffy white sheep. The sheep should be rendered in a style consistent with the background â€“ slightly cartoonish but realistic enough to be identifiable. It should be depicted as grazing, with its head lowered towards the ground.  The sheep should be positioned slightly off-center, to create a more dynamic composition.  It should not be excessively large relative to the clearing, preserving a sense of scale.  The sheep should be slightly shaded to give a sense of depth and form.

**Interaction:** The sheep's presence should subtly alter the scene.  A few small tufts of grass might be slightly disturbed near the sheep, indicating it has been grazing.  The sheep's shadow should also be slightly visible on the ground beneath it, but it should be gentle and softly blended, not sharply defined.  The sheep should appear as if it naturally belongs within the forest clearing scene. The sheep should not appear pasted on, but rather smoothly integrated into the scene.


The overall effect should be a charming and serene image suitable for a children's book or a similar context.  The style should be consistent between the sheep and the background, conveying a unified artistic approach.
