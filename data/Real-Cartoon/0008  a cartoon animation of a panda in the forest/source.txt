Generate a cartoon-style image of a forest clearing. The scene should depict a sandy, gently undulating clearing in the center, taking up roughly the lower half of the frame.  The sand is a pale yellowish-tan, with a few small tufts of bright green grass sparsely scattered across it. The surface is not perfectly smooth; suggest slight undulations and texture to mimic real sand.

The upper half of the image should be filled with a dense forest.  The trees are primarily large, thick-trunked, with dark brown bark, stylized in a cartoonish manner. The leaves are lush and green, in shades of varying intensities.   Use a variety of tree sizes and shapes, creating depth and visual interest. Some trees should be closer to the foreground, others slightly further back, creating a sense of perspective. Undergrowth is present around the base of the trees, consisting of various shades of green and small, colorful bushes. Include a few touches of reddish-brown foliage for variety.

The lighting should be soft and diffused, suggestive of a bright but not harsh day. The overall tone should be warm and inviting, with bright greens and the pale yellow of the sand contrasting pleasingly.  The style should be reminiscent of a childrenâ€™s book illustration, with clean lines, smooth gradients, and slightly exaggerated features. The color palette is limited to earthy tones with a bright accent of green, but maintain vibrancy.  Avoid harsh shadows or deep darks. The overall composition should be balanced, with the clearing as a focal point, framed by the forest.  The image should have a slightly wider aspect ratio, close to square.
