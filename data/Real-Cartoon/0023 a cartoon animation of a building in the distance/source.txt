Generate an image in a vibrant, cartoonish style reminiscent of children's book illustrations.  The scene depicts a park-like setting nestled next to a cityscape.

**Scene:**  The foreground features a sandy path curving gently to the right, leading towards a backdrop of modern, stylized buildings.  A simple wooden bench sits on the path near a small, calm river or stream depicted with bright blue water. Lush green hills, rolling gently, border the path.  The trees and bushes are a mix of autumnal colors (reds, oranges, yellows) and vibrant greens.  Specific foliage includes full, rounded trees with autumn leaves, and brightly colored bushes in the foreground.  Two ornate, dark lamp posts stand symmetrically on either side of the path, flanking the bench. The buildings in the background are clean-lined, light teal or blue-grey skyscrapers, relatively simple in design with few details.

**Lighting:** The lighting should be bright and cheerful, indicative of a sunny day. The scene should be well-lit, with soft shadows suggesting a gentle sun angle, rather than harsh, direct light. The colors should be saturated and slightly exaggerated.

**Style:** The overall style should be cartoonish and whimsical, reminiscent of storybook illustrations.  Lines should be clean and simple, with smooth gradients for shading.  The textures should be relatively smooth, avoiding excessive detail or realism. The image should be appealing to children.

**Composition:** The composition should be balanced, with the path acting as a leading line directing the viewer's eye towards the cityscape in the background. The bench serves as a central point of interest in the foreground.  Trees and foliage frame the path and buildings, creating a natural border. The blue sky should occupy a significant portion of the upper part of the image, providing contrast to the earth tones of the park and buildings.

The overall feeling should be one of peaceful serenity and autumnal joy. The level of detail should be appropriate for a children's book, avoiding overly complex elements.
