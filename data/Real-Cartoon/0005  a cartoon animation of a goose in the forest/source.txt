Generate a cartoon-style image of a forest clearing.  The style should be reminiscent of children's book illustrations, with smooth lines and slightly muted colors.

The scene is dominated by a large, pale yellowish-tan clearing in the center that occupies roughly the lower half of the frame. This clearing is not perfectly flat; it has gentle undulations and a slightly textured appearance, suggesting soft, packed earth.  Scattered across the clearing are small tufts of bright green grass.

The upper half of the image is filled with a dense forest.  The trees are mostly large, with thick, dark brown trunks and full, rounded canopies of varying shades of green.  Some trees are slightly taller than others, creating a sense of depth. The leaves are simple, without intricate detail.  Under the trees, there's a layer of lush, dark green undergrowth with patches of lighter green and some hints of reddish-brown shrubs and bushes for added color variation.

The lighting is soft and diffused, suggestive of a slightly overcast day. There are no harsh shadows, creating a calm and inviting atmosphere.  The overall color palette is fairly muted and natural, with greens, browns, and tans predominating.

The composition is fairly straightforward, with a clear separation between the clearing and the forest, creating a focal point on the open space.  The perspective is slightly downward-looking, providing a view into the forest. Avoid any overly detailed textures or intricate background elements; keep the style simple and clean.
