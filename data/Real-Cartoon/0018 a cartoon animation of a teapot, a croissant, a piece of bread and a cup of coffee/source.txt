Generate a cartoon-style image of a breakfast scene on a red and white checkered tablecloth.Â 


**Scene:** The scene should depict a plate of two fried eggs, a croissant, a wedge of cheese, and a cup of coffee steaming gently. A few small, red cherry tomatoes and some green parsley sprigs are artfully placed on the plate with the eggs.


**Lighting:** The lighting should be bright and cheerful, casting soft shadows. The light source should appear to be from above, illuminating the food items evenly.  There should be a slight, soft glow in the background, suggesting a sunny atmosphere.


**Style:** The style should be bright, clean, and simple, reminiscent of children's illustrations or a whimsical food advertisement. The lines should be smooth and the colors vibrant. The overall aesthetic should be cheerful and inviting.  Use a slightly glossy finish to the food items to enhance their visual appeal. The eggs should have a slightly runny yolk look to them. The cheese should have visible texture and detail.


**Composition:** The food items should be arranged centrally on the tablecloth, with the coffee cup slightly offset to the right. The croissant should be positioned near the bottom center, in between the plate and the coffee. The composition should be balanced, with the various elements arranged in a visually pleasing way. The perspective should be slightly overhead, giving a good view of the breakfast spread.


**Background:** The background should be a pale blue gradient that fades to a lighter shade at the top, suggesting an open and airy space. The tablecloth extends beyond the food, filling most of the image frame.
