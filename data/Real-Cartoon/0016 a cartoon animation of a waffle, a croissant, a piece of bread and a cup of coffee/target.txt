Generate an image of a breakfast scene on a red and white checkered tablecloth.  The background should be a simple, brightly lit illustration of the tablecloth extending to the edges of the frame. 


The foreground consists of several elements:

* **A heart-shaped waffle:** This is the key addition, positioned slightly off-center, on a white plate.  The plate also contains a fried egg, a few small red cherry tomatoes, and a sprig of parsley. The waffle should appear golden brown and crispy, with clearly defined waffle squares and a slightly sugary glaze.  Its heart shape should be distinct but not perfectly geometric.

* **A croissant:** A buttery, golden-brown croissant sits to the lower right of the plate, partially overlapping the tablecloth.  It should be slightly curved, giving it a realistic three-dimensional appearance.

* **A wedge of cheese:** A large, triangular wedge of yellow cheese is situated to the upper right, next to a white coffee cup. The cheese should have visible holes and a slightly shiny texture.

* **A cup of coffee:** A steaming mug of coffee is placed on a saucer to the right of the croissant. The coffee should appear dark and strong, with visible steam rising from it. The mug should be simple and white.

The overall style of the image should be bright, cheerful, and slightly cartoonish. The interaction between the elements should be realistic; there's no significant overlap or unnatural placement, simply a well-arranged breakfast setting. The addition of the heart-shaped waffle enhances the overall romantic or celebratory feel of the scene, while the other elements (croissant, cheese, coffee) reinforce the breakfast theme. The lighting should be even across the entire scene, making all food items appear appetizing and visually appealing.  The colors should be vibrant and natural, and there should be no distracting shadows or elements outside of those specified.
