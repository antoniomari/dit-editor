Generate a cheerful, cartoon-style image of a breakfast scene on a red and white checkered tablecloth.  The style should be similar to a children's book illustration or a simple animated film.

The scene includes:

* **Center:** A plate of two sunny-side-up eggs.  The yolks should be a rich, golden yellow, and the whites should be a creamy white.  A small sprig of parsley sits next to the eggs. Two small, red cherry tomatoes are also on the plate near the parsley.

* **Top Right:** A wedge of cheese.  It should be a pale yellow, with subtle variations in shading to suggest texture. A few small darker spots to imply holes are acceptable.

* **Bottom Left:** A croissant. It should be a rich golden brown, slightly shiny, with visible layers and a slightly irregular shape to show it's freshly baked.

* **Top Middle Right:** A steaming mug of coffee. The mug is white, simple, and cylindrical with a small handle. The steam should be light and wispy, giving a sense of warmth.


* **Tablecloth:** A bright red and white checkered tablecloth provides the backdrop.  The checks are distinct and evenly spaced.

* **Lighting:** The overall lighting should be soft and diffused, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.  Avoid harsh shadows.

* **Background:** A pale blue background hints at an airy setting. It should be slightly brighter near the top, fading down softly.


The composition should be balanced, with the elements arranged in a visually appealing manner. The overall feeling should be one of appetizing wholesomeness.  The image should be high resolution and clean.
