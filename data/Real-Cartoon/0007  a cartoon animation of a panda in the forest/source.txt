Generate a cartoon-style image of a forest clearing.  The scene should be dominated by a large, gently undulating patch of pale beige sand or light earth, occupying roughly the lower two-thirds of the frame.  This sandy area should have a few small, sparsely distributed tufts of bright green grass scattered across its surface.

The upper third of the image should depict a dense forest.  The trees should be stylized, with relatively simple forms and smooth surfaces.  The trunks should be thick, dark brown, and slightly irregular in shape.  The canopies should be lush and full, comprised of deep green leaves.  A variety of tree heights and densities should create depth and visual interest.  Some undergrowth should be visible at the base of the trees, composed of smaller shrubs and bushes in varying shades of green and touches of reddish-brown.

The lighting should be soft and diffused, suggestive of an overcast day or dappled sunlight filtering through the canopy. Avoid harsh shadows; the scene should have a generally warm and inviting atmosphere. The overall style should be reminiscent of children's book illustrations or a friendly, non-threatening game background.  The color palette should be muted but vibrant, with a focus on greens, browns, and the pale beige of the clearing. The composition should be balanced, with the clearing centrally located and providing a visual resting place within the surrounding forest.
