Generate an image of a stylized cartoon park scene with city buildings in the background.

**Background:** The background should depict a cityscape under a bright blue sky with fluffy white clouds.  The buildings are tall, modern-looking structures, with a mix of teal and dark grey/black buildings. The style should be clean and somewhat simplistic, like a child's drawing.  There are at least three distinct teal buildings and a larger, dark grey/black building to the right.

**Foreground:** The foreground element is a park scene added in front of the cityscape. This includes a gently curving paved path winding through a lush green park.Â   The park has rolling hills,  lush green bushes and trees. Some trees should show autumnal colors (yellow and orange leaves).  A wooden park bench is centrally placed along the path, near the water's edge of a stylized river (blueish-green water, simple line-art riverbank). Two ornate lampposts are flanking the bench, one to the left and one to the right, adding to the park atmosphere. In the bottom right, there's a cluster of bright yellow and green leafy bushes, partially obscuring the view of the path's continuation. The overall lighting should be bright and cheerful, mimicking daylight. The artistic style is consistent with the city buildings; simple, cartoony and colorful.

**Interaction:** The park scene is seamlessly integrated into the cityscape background. The park sits in the foreground, effectively creating a contrast between the natural park and the urban background. The city's buildings rise in the background behind the park's hills and trees, making it seem like the park is situated on the edge of the city.

**Overall Scene Changes:** The addition of the park creates a sense of tranquility and calm, offsetting the urban setting. The overall image shifts from solely an urban landscape to a more harmonious combination of urban and natural environments. The bright colours are consistent throughout, maintaining a cheerful atmosphere. The style remains consistently cartoonish and simple throughout the entire composition.
