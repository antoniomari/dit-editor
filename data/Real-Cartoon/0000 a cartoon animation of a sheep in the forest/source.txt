Generate an image of a cartoon forest clearing.  The style should be reminiscent of children's book illustrations, with a bright, slightly muted color palette.

The scene should feature a central, sandy or light-tan clearing that occupies about the lower third of the image.  This clearing is uneven, with subtle undulations and small tufts of bright green grass sparsely scattered across its surface.

The clearing is bordered by a lush green forest floor, slightly shadowed.  The forest itself consists of a variety of deciduous trees with thick, dark brown trunks. The trees are mostly tall and fairly evenly spaced, creating a sense of depth. Their canopies are a mix of deep and lighter greens, and some leaves show variations in shade to indicate depth and sunlight filtering through.  Include some smaller bushes and undergrowth in various shades of green and a touch of red/burgundy for visual interest between the trees.

The lighting should be soft and diffuse, suggesting an overcast day or gentle sunlight filtering through the leaves. There should be no harsh shadows.  The overall mood should be peaceful and inviting. The color palette should be predominantly greens and browns, with accents of lighter yellows and greens in the clearing and small touches of reddish-brown in the undergrowth.  

The composition should be balanced, with the clearing serving as a focal point, drawing the eye in while the trees provide a frame around it. The perspective should be slightly from above, looking down into the clearing. The image should be square or nearly square in aspect ratio.
