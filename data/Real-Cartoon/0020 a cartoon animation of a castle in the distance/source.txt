Generate an image of a park scene in autumn, rendered in a vibrant, cartoon style.  The overall color palette should be bright and cheerful, leaning toward a slightly whimsical feel.

**Scene:** The scene depicts a park path winding gently through a hilly landscape, leading towards a cityscape in the background.  A wooden park bench sits centrally positioned on the light beige sand path, near a calm, stylized river or stream (think less realistic, more painterly).  The path is framed by lush greenery, including various trees in autumn foliage. Some trees show yellows and oranges, others a deep reddish-brown. Bright yellow and green foliage is prominently featured in the foreground, drawing the eye towards the path. The background shows several stylized, modern-looking buildings, hinting at a bustling city.  The buildings are pastel teal and white, giving a clean and modern feel that contrasts nicely with the organic autumnal park.

**Lighting:**  The scene is brightly lit, suggesting a sunny autumn day.  The light source is diffuse and soft, creating minimal shadows and giving a feeling of warmth and contentment.  There's a clear, bright blue sky.

**Style:** The style is distinctly cartoonish, with smooth lines, bold colors, and a lack of highly detailed textures.  Think of a childrenâ€™s book illustration or a whimsical animation background.  The trees and foliage should have a slightly simplified, stylized look, not photorealistic. The overall style should be reminiscent of Disney's animation style from the mid-20th century, but modernized.

**Composition:** The composition is balanced, with the path leading the eye towards the buildings in the background.  The park bench serves as a focal point in the mid-ground. The autumnal colors provide a strong contrast and visual interest, while the light sand path guides the viewer's eye through the composition.  Two lampposts stand on either side of the path, near the park bench, adding depth. The foreground is rich with vegetation, creating a sense of framing around the path and bench.  Clouds in the sky should be simple and fluffy, adding to the cartoonish ambiance.

The overall feel should be idyllic, peaceful, and invite the viewer to relax in the picture-perfect scene.
