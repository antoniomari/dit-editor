Generate an image of a living room scene with a mid-century modern aesthetic. The background should feature a light peach-colored wall, a teal-colored oval rug on the floor, a floor lamp with a rose-pink shade, and a wall-mounted clock with simple black hands.  A picture frame is also on the wall, containing a pastel landscape with a sun, mountains, and a pale pink sky. A small shelf with a cactus and a stack of books is also present on the wall.  A snake plant in a light teal pot is placed to the right of the floor lamp.


The foreground element is a two-drawer light green chest of drawers and a two-seater olive green sofa.  The chest of drawers is placed to the left of the sofa, slightly overlapping its edge.  A small flowering plant in a light orange pot rests on top of the drawers. The sofa is situated centrally in the room, and is facing the viewer. The style of both pieces of furniture should be consistent with the mid-century modern theme, with simple lines and muted colors.

The overall scene should maintain the original background's light and airy feel.  The additions of the chest of drawers and sofa should integrate smoothly, not obscuring any significant background elements. The color palette should remain consistent with muted greens, peaches, and teals, creating a calm and sophisticated atmosphere. The lighting should be soft and diffused, avoiding harsh shadows.  The level of detail should be similar to the original image, maintaining a slightly cartoonish yet polished visual style.
