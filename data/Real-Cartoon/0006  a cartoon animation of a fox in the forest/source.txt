Generate an image of a forest clearing in a cartoon style.  The style should be reminiscent of children's book illustrations, with smooth, slightly rounded shapes and a bright, cheerful color palette.

The scene should focus on a central, gently undulating patch of light beige sand or dirt, occupying the lower half of the frame.  This clearing is sparsely dotted with small tufts of bright green grass.  

The upper half of the frame depicts a forest, composed of a variety of lush green trees with thick brown trunks.  The trees should be fairly evenly spaced, but not in a rigidly uniform pattern. Aim for a natural, slightly overgrown feel.  Include some smaller bushes and shrubs of varying shades of green and reddish-brown at the base of the trees, creating a transition between the forest floor and the clearing.

The lighting should be soft and diffused, suggesting a daytime scene on a partly cloudy day. Avoid harsh shadows; instead, opt for gentle shading to create depth and volume.  The overall atmosphere should be peaceful and inviting.  The colors should be vibrant but not overly saturated. The background should slightly blur the further away the trees are, to provide depth.


The composition should be balanced, with the clearing acting as a focal point, drawing the eye into the scene. The perspective should be slightly from above, providing a comfortable, slightly bird's-eye view of the clearing and the surrounding forest.
