Generate an image of a whimsical cartoon forest scene.  The background should depict a stylized forest clearing with a sandy, light-beige path.  The trees are cartoonish, with thick, brown trunks and lush, bright green canopies.  The undergrowth consists of simplified, brightly colored shrubs and small tufts of grass. The overall style should be reminiscent of children's book illustrations.

In the foreground, centrally placed on the sandy path, is a realistic-looking arctic fox.  The fox should be rendered with high detail, a stark contrast to the cartoonish style of the background. It should be facing towards the viewer's left, appearing alert but calm. The fox's fur should be bright white, and its features sharply defined.   The fox should be realistically scaled, appearing to be approximately 1/3 the height of the average cartoon tree in the background.

The interaction between the foreground and background is a simple overlay; the fox is clearly positioned *in front* of the forest background, with no blending or shadowing that would suggest integration into the background's cartoon style. The overall scene should have a slightly surreal feel due to the juxtaposition of the realistic fox and the cartoon forest.  The lighting is soft and even across the scene; there are no strong shadows. The color palette should be vibrant and cheerful.
