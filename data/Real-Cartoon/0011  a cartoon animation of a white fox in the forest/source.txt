Generate an image of a forest clearing, rendered in a cartoon style with bright, slightly muted colors.  The style should be reminiscent of children's book illustrations.

The scene features a central, irregularly shaped patch of light beige sand or dirt, occupying the lower third of the frame.  Sparse tufts of bright green grass are scattered across this sandy area. The remainder of the image is a forest scene, with several large, thick-trunked trees dominating the composition. These trees should have dark brown, textured bark and full, rounded canopies of varying shades of green. The trees should appear to recede slightly into the background, suggesting depth.  Undergrowth of smaller bushes and shrubs in various greens and hints of red and yellow should fill the spaces between the trees.

The lighting should be soft and diffused, as if on an overcast day or in gentle dappled shade.  There should be no harsh shadows; the overall tone should be peaceful and inviting.  The color palette should be predominantly greens and browns, with touches of warmer yellows and reds in the undergrowth. The perspective should be from a slightly elevated vantage point, looking down into the clearing. The overall composition should be balanced and pleasing to the eye, with the sandy clearing providing a natural focal point. Avoid sharp lines; prioritize a slightly softer, more organic look consistent with the cartoon style.
