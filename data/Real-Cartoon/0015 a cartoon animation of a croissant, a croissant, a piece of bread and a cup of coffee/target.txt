Generate an image of a breakfast scene on a red and white checkered tablecloth.  The background is the tablecloth, extending to all edges, with a light blue sky subtly visible above the table's edge.


The foreground elements are:

* **A large, golden-brown croissant:** This croissant is positioned slightly off-center, to the left. It is placed on a white plate alongside a fried egg, with a few small, red cherry tomatoes and a sprig of green herbs underneath. The croissant appears freshly baked, with visible texture and highlights. Itâ€™s the dominant element in the left section.

* **A smaller croissant:** A smaller, similarly colored and textured croissant is placed in the lower-middle portion of the image, slightly overlapping the tablecloth. This croissant is oriented differently than the first, showing the curved side.

* **A wedge of cheese:** A triangular slice of yellow cheese is placed between the larger croissant and a coffee cup.  The cheese has visible holes and a glossy texture.

* **A mug of coffee:** A white mug of coffee, emitting a small plume of steam, is positioned near the right side. It sits on a white saucer.

The overall scene is a cheerful, appetizing depiction of a breakfast spread.  The lighting should be soft and even, enhancing the textures and colors of the food. The image should have a cartoonish style, with slightly exaggerated features.  The elements should appear slightly glossy, but not overly so. There's no dramatic shadowing; a subtle drop shadow on the plates and mug would be sufficient. The image should maintain a relatively flat perspective, appropriate for a simple, illustrative style.
