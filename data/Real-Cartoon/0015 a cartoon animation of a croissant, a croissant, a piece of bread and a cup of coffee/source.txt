Generate an image of a breakfast scene on a red and white checkered tablecloth.  The style should be cartoonish and bright, similar to a children's illustration.

The scene should include:

* **Center:** A plate of two fried eggs, sunny-side up, with a small garnish of cherry tomatoes and parsley.  The eggs should be bright yellow yolks with slightly crisp, white edges.
* **Top Right:** A wedge of yellow cheese, with visible texture and small holes.  It should appear slightly glossy.
* **Bottom Center:** A golden-brown croissant, slightly curved, with visible texture and some shading to give it depth.
* **Bottom Right:** A white coffee mug, steaming gently, filled with dark brown coffee.  The mug should have a simple, slightly rounded design. A saucer sits beneath it.
* **Background:** A light blue background suggesting an open sky or a bright room, subtly visible above the tablecloth.

The lighting should be soft and even, casting gentle shadows to give the food a three-dimensional appearance, but without harsh contrasts. The overall color palette should be warm and inviting, using bright, saturated colors for the food and a soft, slightly desaturated blue for the background. The tablecloth should be sharply defined, with clear lines between the red and white squares. The composition should be balanced, with the food items arranged naturally and appealingly on the tablecloth. The image should have a high level of detail, capturing the texture of the food and the pattern of the tablecloth. The overall feel should be cheerful and appetizing.
