Generate an image of a red and white checkered tablecloth.  On the tablecloth, position the following items:

* **Foreground Elements:**

    * **Roasted Chicken:** A whole roasted chicken, golden brown and glistening, is placed slightly off-center towards the left. It rests on a simple white plate with a few small red tomatoes and some green parsley sprigs as garnish. The chicken is realistically rendered, showing details like crispy skin and visible stuffing.
    * **Croissant:** A single, golden-brown croissant sits to the bottom right of the chicken, slightly overlapping the plate. It should appear freshly baked with visible layers and a slightly curved shape.
    * **Slice of Cheese:** A large, triangular slice of yellow cheese is positioned near the center-right,  appearing smooth and slightly glossy.  Itâ€™s positioned so that a small portion appears to be behind the cup of coffee.
    * **Coffee Cup:** A white coffee mug, filled with dark brown coffee and emitting a small plume of steam, sits on a matching white saucer to the right of the cheese. The mug is slightly angled towards the right, creating a natural look.

* **Background Interaction:**

The items are arranged naturally on the tablecloth; there is no forced perspective or unnatural overlapping. The colors of the food items contrast pleasantly with the red and white checkered tablecloth, making them stand out. The tablecloth's pattern is not overly prominent but provides a clear context for a breakfast or brunch scene. The background should remain clean and simple.  There's a suggestion of a light blue sky or wall faintly visible in the top area but it does not distract from the main food items.  It should be simple and not visually cluttered.  The overall lighting should be soft and warm, enhancing the appetizing look of the food.

The image should give an impression of a cozy, simple meal setting.  The style should be somewhat cartoonish or stylized, maintaining the realism of the food while enhancing its visual appeal. The interaction between the elements is natural, as if they're part of a casually arranged meal.  Ensure there's no harsh shadows or overly saturated colors, opting for a more gentle and inviting aesthetic.
