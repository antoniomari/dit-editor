Generate an image of a breakfast scene on a red and white checkered tablecloth. The style should be cartoonish and vibrant, similar to a children's book illustration.  

The scene includes:

* **Center:** A white plate holding two fried eggs. The yolks are bright yellow and sunny-side up.  The whites are slightly crisp and neatly shaped. A small sprig of parsley and two halved cherry tomatoes are placed artfully next to the eggs.

* **Top Right:** A wedge of cheese, light yellow in color, with visible small holes.  It should look slightly melted or soft.

* **Bottom Left:** A buttery croissant, light golden-brown. Itâ€™s slightly curved and shows some texture.

* **Bottom Right:** A white mug filled with steaming coffee. The steam should be stylized, not photorealistic. The mug should be slightly reflective. Next to the mug is a white saucer.


* **Background:** A light blue background suggesting a bright, airy room, slightly blurred to emphasize the foreground.

* **Tablecloth:** A red and white checkered tablecloth, neatly folded. The checks are evenly spaced and crisp.

The lighting should be soft and even, illuminating all the food items equally.  The overall composition should be cheerful and appetizing. The image should have a slight shine or gloss on the food items, implying freshness. The colors should be rich and saturated, without being overly bright or harsh.  The entire scene should be neatly arranged, suggesting a pleasant and welcoming breakfast setting.
