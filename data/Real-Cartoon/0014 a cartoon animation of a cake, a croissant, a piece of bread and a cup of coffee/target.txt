Generate an image of a red and white checkered picnic table.  On the table, centered, is a round light-blue frosted cake decorated with a stylized double-S design.  The cake is on a white plate with a few red berries and some green garnish. To the upper right of the cake is a wedge of yellow cheese, positioned slightly overlapping the cake plate. Steam rises from the cheese.  To the lower right of the cake is a croissant, golden brown and slightly curved. Lower right, next to the croissant, is a white coffee mug filled with dark brown coffee, steam rising from the surface. The coffee mug sits on a white saucer. The overall scene is bright and cheerful, with a cartoonish style.  The added elements, the cake, cheese, croissant, and coffee cup are all distinct but arranged together on the tablecloth to suggest a breakfast or brunch setting.  The lighting is even, highlighting the texture of the food. The background is a simple, slightly blurred light blue suggesting sky or outdoor space. The focus is clearly on the food items on the table.
